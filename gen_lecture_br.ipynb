              " Document(page_content='Preface\\nThe strange history of this book\\nIn January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had\\ntaught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high\\nand, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.\\nOne of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary\\ndetail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all\\nsuffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then\\nsomewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much\\nnew material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.\\nTwo weeks before the ﬁrst day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:\\n• Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.\\n• Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize jargon and deﬁne each term at ﬁrst\\nuse.\\n• Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difﬁcult topics and split them\\ninto a series of small steps.\\n• Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum\\nuseful subset of Java and left out the rest.\\nI needed a title, so on a whim I chose How to Think Like a Computer Scientist .\\nMy ﬁrst version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood\\nenough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most\\nimportant) letting the students practice.\\nI released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to\\ncopy, modify, and distribute the book.\\nWhat happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted\\nmy book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the\\nunusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book. As Green Tea Press, I\\npublished the ﬁrst Python version in 2001.\\nIn 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the ﬁrst time. The\\ncontrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more\\ninteresting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='vi Chapter 0. Preface\\nSince then I’ve continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the\\nexamples and adding material, especially exercises.\\nThe result is this book, now with the less grandiose title Think Python . Some of the changes\\nare:\\n• I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present\\ngeneral techniques for ﬁnding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pit-\\nfalls.\\n• I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial\\nprojects. Most exercises include a link to my solution.\\n• I added a series of case studies—longer examples with exercises, solutions, and dis-\\ncussion.\\n• I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic design patterns.\\n• I added appendices about debugging and analysis of algorithms.\\nThe second edition of Think Python has these new features:\\n• The book and all supporting code have been updated to Python 3.\\n• I added a few sections, and more details on the web, to help beginners get started\\nrunning Python in a browser, so you don’t have to deal with installing Python until\\nyou want to.\\n• For Chapter 4.1 I switched from my own turtle graphics package, called Swampy, to a\\nmore standard Python module, turtle , which is easier to install and more powerful.\\n• I added a new chapter called “The Goodies”, which introduces some additional\\nPython features that are not strictly necessary, but sometimes handy.\\nI hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think\\nlike a computer scientist, at least a little bit.\\nAllen B.

              " Document(page_content='Chapter 1\\nThe way of the program\\nThe goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of think-\\ning combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.\\nLike mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (speciﬁ-\\ncally computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into sys-\\ntems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behav-\\nior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\\nThe single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving . Problem solv-\\ning means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express\\na solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an\\nexcellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called,\\n“The way of the program”.\\nOn one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you\\nwill use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.\\n1.1 What is a program?\\nAprogram is a sequence of instructions that speciﬁes how to perform a computation. The\\ncomputation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or\\nﬁnding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as search-\\ning and replacing text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or\\nplaying a video.\\nThe details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just\\nabout every language:\\ninput: Get data from the keyboard, a ﬁle, the network, or some other device.\\noutput: Display data on the screen, save it in a ﬁle, send it over the network, etc.\\nmath: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.\\nconditional execution: Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='2 Chapter 1. The way of the program\\nrepetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\\nBelieve it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used,\\nno matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these.\\nSo you can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into\\nsmaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with\\none of these basic instructions.\\n1.2 Running Python\\nOne of the challenges of getting started with Python is that you might have to install\\nPython and related software on your computer. If you are familiar with your operating\\nsystem, and especially if you are comfortable with the command-line interface, you will\\nhave no trouble installing Python. But for beginners, it can be painful to learn about sys-\\ntem administration and programming at the same time.\\nTo avoid that problem, I recommend that you start out running Python in a browser. Later,\\nwhen you are comfortable with Python, I’ll make suggestions for installing Python on your\\ncomputer.\\nThere are a number of web pages you can use to run Python. If you already have a fa-\\nvorite, go ahead and use it. Otherwise I recommend PythonAnywhere. I provide detailed\\ninstructions for getting started at http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e .\\nThere are two versions of Python, called Python 2 and Python 3. They are very similar, so\\nif you learn one, it is easy to switch to the other. In fact, there are only a few differences you\\nwill encounter as a beginner. This book is written for Python 3, but I include some notes\\nabout Python 2.\\nThe Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. Depending\\non your environment, you might start the interpreter by clicking on an icon, or by typing\\npython on a command line. When it starts, you should see output like this:\\nPython 3.4.0 (default, Jun 19 2015, 14:20:21)\\n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux\\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\\n>>>\\nThe ﬁrst three lines contain information about the interpreter and the operating system it’s\\nrunning on, so it might be different for you. But you should check that the version number,\\nwhich is 3.4.0 in this example, begins with 3, which indicates that you are running Python\\n3. If it begins with 2, you are running (you guessed it) Python 2.\\nThe last line is a prompt that indicates that the interpreter is ready for you to enter code. If\\nyou type a line of code and hit Enter, the interpreter displays the result:\\n>>> 1 + 1\\n2\\nNow you’re ready to get started. From here on, I assume that you know how to start the\\nPython interpreter and run code.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"1.3. The ﬁrst program 3\\n1.3 The ﬁrst program\\nTraditionally, the ﬁrst program you write in a new language is called “Hello, World!” be-\\ncause all it does is display the words “Hello, World!”. In Python, it looks like this:\\n>>> print( 'Hello, World! ')\\nThis is an example of a print statement , although it doesn’t actually print anything on\\npaper. It displays a result on the screen. In this case, the result is the words\\nHello, World!\\nThe quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be dis-\\nplayed; they don’t appear in the result.\\nThe parentheses indicate that print is a function. We’ll get to functions in Chapter 3.\\nIn Python 2, the print statement is slightly different; it is not a function, so it doesn’t use\\nparentheses.\\n>>> print 'Hello, World! '\\nThis distinction will make more sense soon, but that’s enough to get started.\\n1.4 Arithmetic operators\\nAfter “Hello, World”, the next step is arithmetic. Python provides operators , which are\\nspecial symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.\\nThe operators +,-, and *perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, as in the fol-\\nlowing examples:\\n>>> 40 + 2\\n42\\n>>> 43 - 1\\n42\\n>>> 6 * 7\\n42\\nThe operator /performs division:\\n>>> 84 / 2\\n42.0\\nYou might wonder why the result is 42.0 instead of 42. I’ll explain in the next section.\\nFinally, the operator **performs exponentiation; that is, it raises a number to a power:\\n>>> 6**2 + 6\\n42\\nIn some other languages, ^is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator\\ncalled XOR. If you are not familiar with bitwise operators, the result will surprise you:\\n>>> 6 ^ 2\\n4\\nI won’t cover bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about them at http://wiki.\\npython.org/moin/BitwiseOperators .\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"4 Chapter 1. The way of the program\\n1.5 Values and types\\nAvalue is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. Some\\nvalues we have seen so far are 2,42.0 , and 'Hello, World! '.\\nThese values belong to different types :2is an integer ,42.0 is aﬂoating-point number , and\\n'Hello, World! 'is astring , so-called because the letters it contains are strung together.\\nIf you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you:\\n>>> type(2)\\n<class 'int'>\\n>>> type(42.0)\\n<class 'float '>\\n>>> type( 'Hello, World! ')\\n<class 'str'>\\nIn these results, the word “class” is used in the sense of a category; a type is a category of\\nvalues.\\nNot surprisingly, integers belong to the type int, strings belong to strand ﬂoating-point\\nnumbers belong to float .\\nWhat about values like '2'and'42.0 '? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation\\nmarks like strings.\\n>>> type( '2')\\n<class 'str'>\\n>>> type( '42.0 ')\\n<class 'str'>\\nThey’re strings.\\nWhen you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of\\ndigits, as in 1,000,000 . This is not a legal integer in Python, but it is legal:\\n>>> 1,000,000\\n(1, 0, 0)\\nThat’s not what we expected at all! Python interprets 1,000,000 as a comma-separated\\nsequence of integers. We’ll learn more about this kind of sequence later.\\n1.6 Formal and natural languages\\nNatural languages are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French.\\nThey were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them);\\nthey evolved naturally.\\nFormal languages are languages that are designed by people for speciﬁc applications. For\\nexample, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly\\ngood at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal lan-\\nguage to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:\\nProgramming languages are formal languages that have been designed to\\nexpress computations.\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='1.6. Formal and natural languages 5\\nFormal languages tend to have strict syntax rules that govern the structure of statements.\\nFor example, in mathematics the statement 3 +3=6 has correct syntax, but 3 + = 3$6\\ndoes not. In chemistry H2Ois a syntactically correct formula, but 2Zzis not.\\nSyntax rules come in two ﬂavors, pertaining to tokens and structure. Tokens are the basic\\nelements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the\\nproblems with 3 + = 3$6 is that $ is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as I\\nknow). Similarly, 2Zzis not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation Zz.\\nThe second type of syntax rule pertains to the way tokens are combined. The equation\\n3+/3 is illegal because even though +and / are legal tokens, you can’t have one right\\nafter the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name,\\nnot before.\\nThis is @ well-structured Engli$h sentence with invalid t*kens in it. This sentence all valid\\ntokens has, but invalid structure with.\\nWhen you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to\\nﬁgure out the structure (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This\\nprocess is called parsing .\\nAlthough formal and natural languages have many features in common—tokens, struc-\\nture, and syntax—there are some differences:\\nambiguity: Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using con-\\ntextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or\\ncompletely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning,\\nregardless of context.\\nredundancy: In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural\\nlanguages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal\\nlanguages are less redundant and more concise.\\nliteralness: Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If I say, “The penny\\ndropped”, there is probably no penny and nothing dropping (this idiom means that\\nsomeone understood something after a period of confusion). Formal languages mean\\nexactly what they say.\\nBecause we all grow up speaking natural languages, it is sometimes hard to adjust to for-\\nmal languages. The difference between formal and natural language is like the difference\\nbetween poetry and prose, but more so:\\nPoetry: Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem\\ntogether creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but\\noften deliberate.\\nProse: The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more\\nmeaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.\\nPrograms: The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be\\nunderstood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='6 Chapter 1. The way of the program\\nFormal languages are more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them.\\nAlso, the structure is important, so it is not always best to read from top to bottom, left to\\nright. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and inter-\\npreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation,\\nwhich you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal\\nlanguage.\\n1.7 Debugging\\nProgrammers make mistakes. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called bugs\\nand the process of tracking them down is called debugging .\\nProgramming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong emotions.

In general, statements don’t have values.\\n2.4 Script mode\\nSo far we have run Python in interactive mode , which means that you interact directly\\nwith the interpreter. Interactive mode is a good way to get started, but if you are working\\nwith more than a few lines of code, it can be clumsy.\\nThe alternative is to save code in a ﬁle called a script and then run the interpreter in script\\nmode to execute the script. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with .py.\\nIf you know how to create and run a script on your computer, you are ready to go. Oth-\\nerwise I recommend using PythonAnywhere again. I have posted instructions for running\\nin script mode at http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e .\\nBecause Python provides both modes, you can test bits of code in interactive mode before\\nyou put them in a script. But there are differences between interactive mode and script\\nmode that can be confusing.\\nFor example, if you are using Python as a calculator, you might type\\n>>> miles = 26.2\\n>>> miles * 1.61\\n42.182\\nThe ﬁrst line assigns a value to miles , but it has no visible effect. The second line is an ex-\\npression, so the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result. It turns out that a marathon\\nis about 42 kilometers.\\nBut if you type the same code into a script and run it, you get no output at all. In script\\nmode an expression, all by itself, has no visible effect. Python evaluates the expression, but\\nit doesn’t display the result. To display the result, you need a print statement like this:\\nmiles = 26.2\\nprint(miles * 1.61)\\nThis behavior can be confusing at ﬁrst. To check your understanding, type the following\\nstatements in the Python interpreter and see what they do:\\n5\\nx = 5\\nx + 1\\nNow put the same statements in a script and run it. What is the output? Modify the script\\nby transforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again.\\n2.5 Order of operations\\nWhen an expression contains more than one operator, the order of evaluation depends\\non the order of operations .

Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated ﬁrst,\\n2 * (3-1) is 4, and (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an\\nexpression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60 , even if it doesn’t change the\\nresult.\\n•Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so 1 + 2**3 is 9, not 27, and 2 *\\n3**2 is 18, not 36.\\n•Multiplication and Division have higher precedence than Addition and Subtraction.\\nSo2*3-1 is 5, not 4, and 6+4/2 is 8, not 5.\\n• Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponen-\\ntiation). So in the expression degrees / 2 * pi , the division happens ﬁrst and the\\nresult is multiplied by pi. To divide by 2 π, you can use parentheses or write degrees\\n/ 2 / pi .\\nI don’t work very hard to remember the precedence of operators. If I can’t tell by looking\\nat the expression, I use parentheses to make it obvious.\\n2.6 String operations\\nIn general, you can’t perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look\\nlike numbers, so the following are illegal:\\n'chinese '-'food ' ' eggs '/'easy ' ' third '*'a charm '\\nBut there are two exceptions, +and*.\\nThe+operator performs string concatenation , which means it joins the strings by linking\\nthem end-to-end. For example:\\n>>> first = 'throat '\\n>>> second = 'warbler '\\n>>> first + second\\nthroatwarbler\\nThe *operator also works on strings; it performs repetition. For example, 'Spam '*3is\\n'SpamSpamSpam '. If one of the values is a string, the other has to be an integer.\\nThis use of +and *makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication. Just as 4*3\\nis equivalent to 4+4+4 , we expect 'Spam '*3to be the same as 'Spam '+'Spam '+'Spam ', and\\nit is. On the other hand, there is a signiﬁcant way in which string concatenation and repe-\\ntition are different from integer addition and multiplication.

It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.\\nSyntax error: “Syntax” refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that struc-\\nture. For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so (1 + 2) is legal,\\nbut8)is asyntax error .\\nIf there is a syntax error anywhere in your program, Python displays an error mes-\\nsage and quits, and you will not be able to run the program. During the ﬁrst few\\nweeks of your programming career, you might spend a lot of time tracking down\\nsyntax errors. As you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and ﬁnd them\\nfaster.\\nRuntime error: The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does\\nnot appear until after the program has started running. These errors are also called\\nexceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has\\nhappened.\\nRuntime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the ﬁrst few chapters,\\nso it might be a while before you encounter one.\\nSemantic error: The third type of error is “semantic”, which means related to meaning.\\nIf there is a semantic error in your program, it will run without generating error\\nmessages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Speciﬁcally, it\\nwill do what you told it to do.\\nIdentifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward\\nby looking at the output of the program and trying to ﬁgure out what it is doing.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",

A\\nmodule is a ﬁle that contains a collection of related functions.\\nBefore we can use the functions in a module, we have to import it with an import state-\\nment :\\n>>> import math\\nThis statement creates a module object named math. If you display the module object, you\\nget some information about it:\\n>>> math\\n<module 'math '(built-in)>\\nThe module object contains the functions and variables deﬁned in the module. To access\\none of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the\\nfunction, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called dot notation .\\n>>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power\\n>>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)\\n>>> radians = 0.7\\n>>> height = math.sin(radians)\\nThe ﬁrst example uses math.log10 to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (assuming\\nthat signal_power and noise_power are deﬁned). The math module also provides log,\\nwhich computes logarithms base e.\\nThe second example ﬁnds the sine of radians . The variable name radians is a hint that\\nsin and the other trigonometric functions ( cos,tan, etc.) take arguments in radians.

A function deﬁnition speciﬁes the name of a new function and the\\nsequence of statements that run when the function is called.\\nHere is an example:\\ndef print_lyrics():\\nprint(\"I \\'m a lumberjack, and I \\'m okay.\")\\nprint(\"I sleep all night and I work all day.\")\\ndefis a keyword that indicates that this is a function deﬁnition. The name of the function\\nisprint_lyrics . The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters,\\nnumbers and underscore are legal, but the ﬁrst character can’t be a number. You can’t use a\\nkeyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function\\nwith the same name.\\nThe empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any argu-\\nments.\\nThe ﬁrst line of the function deﬁnition is called the header ; the rest is called the body . The\\nheader has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, indentation\\nis always four spaces. The body can contain any number of statements.\\nThe strings in the print statements are enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes and double\\nquotes do the same thing; most people use single quotes except in cases like this where a\\nsingle quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string.\\nAll quotation marks (single and double) must be “straight quotes”, usually located next\\nto Enter on the keyboard. “Curly quotes”, like the ones in this sentence, are not legal in\\nPython.\\nIf you type a function deﬁnition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints dots ( ...) to let\\nyou know that the deﬁnition isn’t complete:', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 40}),\n",

In other words,\\nthe function deﬁnition has to run before the function gets called.\\nAs an exercise, move the last line of this program to the top, so the function call appears\\nbefore the deﬁnitions. Run the program and see what error message you get.\\nNow move the function call back to the bottom and move the deﬁnition of print_lyrics\\nafter the deﬁnition of repeat_lyrics . What happens when you run this program?\\n3.6 Flow of execution\\nTo ensure that a function is deﬁned before its ﬁrst use, you have to know the order state-\\nments run in, which is called the ﬂow of execution .\\nExecution always begins at the ﬁrst statement of the program. Statements are run one at a\\ntime, in order from top to bottom.\\nFunction deﬁnitions do not alter the ﬂow of execution of the program, but remember that\\nstatements inside the function don’t run until the function is called.\\nA function call is like a detour in the ﬂow of execution. Instead of going to the next state-\\nment, the ﬂow jumps to the body of the function, runs the statements there, and then comes\\nback to pick up where it left off.\\nThat sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While\\nin the middle of one function, the program might have to run the statements in another\\nfunction. Then, while running that new function, the program might have to run yet an-\\nother function!\\nFortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function com-\\npletes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to\\nthe end of the program, it terminates.\\nIn summary, when you read a program, you don’t always want to read from top to bottom.\\nSometimes it makes more sense if you follow the ﬂow of execution.\\n3.7 Parameters and arguments\\nSome of the functions we have seen require arguments. For example, when you call\\nmath.sin you pass a number as an argument. Some functions take more than one ar-\\ngument: math.pow takes two, the base and the exponent.\\nInside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called parameters . Here is a\\ndeﬁnition for a function that takes an argument:\\ndef print_twice(bruce):\\nprint(bruce)\\nprint(bruce)\\nThis function assigns the argument to a parameter named bruce .

Like state diagrams, stack diagrams show the value of each variable, but they\\nalso show the function each variable belongs to.\\nEach function is represented by a frame . A frame is a box with the name of a function\\nbeside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it. The stack diagram for\\nthe previous example is shown in Figure 3.1.\\nThe frames are arranged in a stack that indicates which function called which, and so\\non. In this example, print_twice was called by cat_twice , and cat_twice was called\\nby__main__ , which is a special name for the topmost frame. When you create a variable\\noutside of any function, it belongs to __main__ .\\nEach parameter refers to the same value as its corresponding argument. So, part1 has the\\nsame value as line1 ,part2 has the same value as line2 , and bruce has the same value as\\ncat.\\nIf an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the name of the function, the name\\nof the function that called it, and the name of the function that called that, all the way back\\nto__main__ .\\nFor example, if you try to access catfrom within print_twice , you get a NameError :\\nTraceback (innermost last):\\nFile \"test.py\", line 13, in __main__\\ncat_twice(line1, line2)\\nFile \"test.py\", line 5, in cat_twice\\nprint_twice(cat)\\nFile \"test.py\", line 9, in print_twice\\nprint(cat)\\nNameError: name \\'cat\\'is not defined', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 44}),\n",

Other functions, like print_twice , perform\\nan action but don’t return a value. They are called void functions .\\nWhen you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something with the result;\\nfor example, you might assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression:\\nx = math.cos(radians)\\ngolden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2\\nWhen you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays the result:\\n>>> math.sqrt(5)\\n2.2360679774997898\\nBut in a script, if you call a fruitful function all by itself, the return value is lost forever!\\nmath.sqrt(5)\\nThis script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn’t store or display the result, it\\nis not very useful.\\nVoid functions might display something on the screen or have some other effect, but they\\ndon’t have a return value. If you assign the result to a variable, you get a special value\\ncalled None .\\n>>> result = print_twice( 'Bing ')\\nBing\\nBing\\n>>> print(result)\\nNone\\nThe value None is not the same as the string 'None '. It is a special value that has its own\\ntype:\\n>>> type(None)\\n<class 'NoneType '>\\nThe functions we have written so far are all void.

Once you have an idea about what is going\\nwrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, you can\\npredict the result of the modiﬁcation, and you take a step closer to a working program. If\\nyour hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes\\npointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however im-\\nprobable, must be the truth.” (A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four )\\nFor some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming\\nis the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is\\nthat you should start with a working program and make small modiﬁcations, debugging\\nthem as you go.\\nFor example, Linux is an operating system that contains millions of lines of code, but it\\nstarted out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip.

A method\\nis similar to a function, but it uses slightly different syntax. For example, to move the turtle\\nforward:\\nbob.fd(100)\\nThe method, fd, is associated with the turtle object we’re calling bob.

The extra turn takes more\\ntime, but it simpliﬁes the code if we do the same thing every time through the loop.

In that case, why not call the parameter bob? The idea is that tcan be any\\nturtle, not just bob, so you could create a second turtle and pass it as an argument to square :\\nalice = turtle.Turtle()\\nsquare(alice)\\nWrapping a piece of code up in a function is called encapsulation . One of the beneﬁts of\\nencapsulation is that it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documenta-\\ntion. Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, it is more concise to call a function\\ntwice than to copy and paste the body!\\n4.5 Generalization\\nThe next step is to add a length parameter to square . Here is a solution:\\ndef square(t, length):\\nfor i in range(4):\\nt.fd(length)\\nt.lt(90)\\nsquare(bob, 100)\\nAdding a parameter to a function is called generalization because it makes the function\\nmore general: in the previous version, the square is always the same size; in this version it\\ncan be any size.\\nThe next step is also a generalization. Instead of drawing squares, polygon draws regular\\npolygons with any number of sides. Here is a solution:\\ndef polygon(t, n, length):\\nangle = 360 / n\\nfor i in range(n):\\nt.fd(length)\\nt.lt(angle)\\npolygon(bob, 7, 70)', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",

A\\nsimple solution is to compute angle = 360.0 / n . Because the numerator is a ﬂoating-\\npoint number, the result is ﬂoating point.\\nWhen a function has more than a few numeric arguments, it is easy to forget what they are,\\nor what order they should be in. In that case it is often a good idea to include the names of\\nthe parameters in the argument list:\\npolygon(bob, n=7, length=70)\\nThese are called keyword arguments because they include the parameter names as “key-\\nwords” (not to be confused with Python keywords like while anddef).\\nThis syntax makes the program more readable. It is also a reminder about how arguments\\nand parameters work: when you call a function, the arguments are assigned to the param-\\neters.\\n4.6 Interface design\\nThe next step is to write circle , which takes a radius, r, as a parameter. Here is a simple\\nsolution that uses polygon to draw a 50-sided polygon:\\nimport math\\ndef circle(t, r):\\ncircumference = 2 * math.pi * r\\nn = 50\\nlength = circumference / n\\npolygon(t, n, length)\\nThe ﬁrst line computes the circumference of a circle with radius rusing the formula 2 πr.\\nSince we use math.pi , we have to import math .

Thus, polygon draws a 50-sided polygon that approximates a circle with\\nradius r.\\nOne limitation of this solution is that nis a constant, which means that for very big circles,\\nthe line segments are too long, and for small circles, we waste time drawing very small\\nsegments. One solution would be to generalize the function by taking nas a parameter.\\nThis would give the user (whoever calls circle ) more control, but the interface would be\\nless clean.\\nThe interface of a function is a summary of how it is used: what are the parameters? What\\ndoes the function do? And what is the return value? An interface is “clean” if it allows the\\ncaller to do what they want without dealing with unnecessary details.\\nIn this example, rbelongs in the interface because it speciﬁes the circle to be drawn. nis\\nless appropriate because it pertains to the details of how the circle should be rendered.\\nRather than clutter up the interface, it is better to choose an appropriate value of ndepend-\\ning on circumference :', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 54}),\n",

But ﬁrst I want to introduce two new operators: ﬂoor division\\nand modulus.\\n5.1 Floor division and modulus\\nThe ﬂoor division operator, //, divides two numbers and rounds down to an integer. For\\nexample, suppose the run time of a movie is 105 minutes. You might want to know how\\nlong that is in hours. Conventional division returns a ﬂoating-point number:\\n>>> minutes = 105\\n>>> minutes / 60\\n1.75\\nBut we don’t normally write hours with decimal points. Floor division returns the integer\\nnumber of hours, rounding down:\\n>>> minutes = 105\\n>>> hours = minutes // 60\\n>>> hours\\n1\\nTo get the remainder, you could subtract off one hour in minutes:\\n>>> remainder = minutes - hours * 60\\n>>> remainder\\n45\\nAn alternative is to use the modulus operator ,%, which divides two numbers and returns\\nthe remainder.\\n>>> remainder = minutes % 60\\n>>> remainder\\n45\\nThe modulus operator is more useful than it seems. For example, you can check whether\\none number is divisible by another—if x % y is zero, then xis divisible by y.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 60}),\n",

For example, x % 10\\nyields the right-most digit of x(in base 10). Similarly x % 100 yields the last two digits.\\nIf you are using Python 2, division works differently. The division operator, /, performs\\nﬂoor division if both operands are integers, and ﬂoating-point division if either operand is\\nafloat .\\n5.2 Boolean expressions\\nAboolean expression is an expression that is either true or false. The following examples\\nuse the operator ==, which compares two operands and produces True if they are equal\\nandFalse otherwise:\\n>>> 5 == 5\\nTrue\\n>>> 5 == 6\\nFalse\\nTrue andFalse are special values that belong to the type bool ; they are not strings:\\n>>> type(True)\\n<class 'bool '>\\n>>> type(False)\\n<class 'bool '>\\nThe==operator is one of the relational operators ; the others are:\\nx != y # x is not equal to y\\nx > y # x is greater than y\\nx < y # x is less than y\\nx >= y # x is greater than or equal to y\\nx <= y # x is less than or equal to y\\nAlthough these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are different\\nfrom the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single equal sign ( =) instead of\\na double equal sign ( ==). Remember that =is an assignment operator and ==is a relational\\noperator. There is no such thing as =<or=>.\\n5.3 Logical operators\\nThere are three logical operators :and,or, and not. The semantics (meaning) of these\\noperators is similar to their meaning in English. For example, x > 0 and x < 10 is true\\nonly if xis greater than 0 andless than 10.\\nn%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0 is true if either or both of the conditions is true, that is, if the number\\nis divisible by 2 or3.\\nFinally, the not operator negates a boolean expression, so not (x > y) is true if x > y is\\nfalse, that is, if xis less than or equal to y.\\nStrictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be boolean expressions, but\\nPython is not very strict.

Conditional statements give us this\\nability. The simplest form is the ifstatement:\\nif x > 0:\\nprint( 'x is positive ')\\nThe boolean expression after ifis called the condition . If it is true, the indented statement\\nruns. If not, nothing happens.\\nifstatements have the same structure as function deﬁnitions: a header followed by an\\nindented body. Statements like this are called compound statements .\\nThere is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the body, but there has to\\nbe at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually as a\\nplace keeper for code you haven’t written yet). In that case, you can use the pass statement,\\nwhich does nothing.\\nif x < 0:\\npass # TODO: need to handle negative values!\\n5.5 Alternative execution\\nA second form of the ifstatement is “alternative execution”, in which there are two possi-\\nbilities and the condition determines which one runs. The syntax looks like this:\\nif x % 2 == 0:\\nprint( 'x is even ')\\nelse:\\nprint( 'x is odd ')\\nIf the remainder when xis divided by 2 is 0, then we know that xis even, and the program\\ndisplays an appropriate message. If the condition is false, the second set of statements\\nruns. Since the condition must be true or false, exactly one of the alternatives will run. The\\nalternatives are called branches , because they are branches in the ﬂow of execution.\\n5.6 Chained conditionals\\nSometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches.\\nOne way to express a computation like that is a chained conditional :\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 62}),\n",

If the ﬁrst is false, the next is checked, and so on. If one\\nof them is true, the corresponding branch runs and the statement ends. Even if more than\\none condition is true, only the ﬁrst true branch runs.\\n5.7 Nested conditionals\\nOne conditional can also be nested within another. We could have written the example in\\nthe previous section like this:\\nif x == y:\\nprint( 'x and y are equal ')\\nelse:\\nif x < y:\\nprint( 'x is less than y ')\\nelse:\\nprint( 'x is greater than y ')\\nThe outer conditional contains two branches. The ﬁrst branch contains a simple statement.\\nThe second branch contains another ifstatement, which has two branches of its own.\\nThose two branches are both simple statements, although they could have been conditional\\nstatements as well.\\nAlthough the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, nested condi-\\ntionals become difﬁcult to read very quickly. It is a good idea to avoid them when you\\ncan.\\nLogical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements. For ex-\\nample, we can rewrite the following code using a single conditional:\\nif 0 < x:\\nif x < 10:\\nprint( 'x is a positive single-digit number. ')\\nTheprint statement runs only if we make it past both conditionals, so we can get the same\\neffect with the andoperator:\\nif 0 < x and x < 10:\\nprint( 'x is a positive single-digit number.

For example, look at the following function:\\ndef countdown(n):\\nif n <= 0:\\nprint( 'Blastoff!

But we will see\\nexamples later that are hard to write with a forloop and easy to write with recursion, so it\\nis good to start early.\\n5.9 Stack diagrams for recursive functions\\nIn Section 3.9, we used a stack diagram to represent the state of a program during a function\\ncall. The same kind of diagram can help interpret a recursive function.\\nEvery time a function gets called, Python creates a frame to contain the function’s local\\nvariables and parameters. For a recursive function, there might be more than one frame on\\nthe stack at the same time.\\nFigure 5.1 shows a stack diagram for countdown called with n = 3 .\\nAs usual, the top of the stack is the frame for __main__ . It is empty because we did not\\ncreate any variables in __main__ or pass any arguments to it.\\nThe four countdown frames have different values for the parameter n. The bottom of the\\nstack, where n=0, is called the base case . It does not make a recursive call, so there are no\\nmore frames.\\nAs an exercise, draw a stack diagram for print_n called with s = 'Hello 'andn=2. Then\\nwrite a function called do_n that takes a function object and a number, n, as arguments, and\\nthat calls the given function ntimes.\\n5.10 Inﬁnite recursion\\nIf a recursion never reaches a base case, it goes on making recursive calls forever, and the\\nprogram never terminates.

The\\nreturn value is the distance represented by a ﬂoating-point value.\\nImmediately you can write an outline of the function:\\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\\nreturn 0.0', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 73}),\n",

When testing a function, it is\\nuseful to know the right answer.\\nAt this point we have conﬁrmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start\\nadding code to the body. A reasonable next step is to ﬁnd the differences x2−x1and\\ny2−y1. The next version stores those values in temporary variables and prints them.\\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\\ndx = x2 - x1\\ndy = y2 - y1\\nprint( 'dx is ', dx)\\nprint( 'dy is ', dy)\\nreturn 0.0\\nIf the function is working, it should display dx is 3 anddy is 4 . If so, we know that the\\nfunction is getting the right arguments and performing the ﬁrst computation correctly. If\\nnot, there are only a few lines to check.\\nNext we compute the sum of squares of dxanddy:\\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\\ndx = x2 - x1\\ndy = y2 - y1\\ndsquared = dx**2 + dy**2\\nprint( 'dsquared is: ', dsquared)\\nreturn 0.0\\nAgain, you would run the program at this stage and check the output (which should be\\n25). Finally, you can use math.sqrt to compute and return the result:\\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\\ndx = x2 - x1\\ndy = y2 - y1\\ndsquared = dx**2 + dy**2\\nresult = math.sqrt(dsquared)\\nreturn result\\nIf that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to print the value of\\nresult before the return statement.\\nThe ﬁnal version of the function doesn’t display anything when it runs; it only returns\\na value. The print statements we wrote are useful for debugging, but once you get the\\nfunction working, you should remove them. Code like that is called scaffolding because it\\nis helpful for building the program but is not part of the ﬁnal product.\\nWhen you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a time.

An alternative is what I call the “leap of faith”. When you come to a\\nfunction call, instead of following the ﬂow of execution, you assume that the function works\\ncorrectly and returns the right result.\\nIn fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use built-in functions. When\\nyou call math.cos ormath.exp , you don’t examine the bodies of those functions. You just\\nassume that they work because the people who wrote the built-in functions were good\\nprogrammers.\\nThe same is true when you call one of your own functions. For example, in Section 6.4, we\\nwrote a function called is_divisible that determines whether one number is divisible by\\nanother. Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is correct—by examining the\\ncode and testing—we can use the function without looking at the body again.\\nThe same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive call, instead of\\nfollowing the ﬂow of execution, you should assume that the recursive call works (returns\\nthe correct result) and then ask yourself, “Assuming that I can ﬁnd the factorial of n−1,\\ncan I compute the factorial of n?” It is clear that you can, by multiplying by n.\\nOf course, it’s a bit strange to assume that the function works correctly when you haven’t\\nﬁnished writing it, but that’s why it’s called a leap of faith!\\n6.7 One more example\\nAfter factorial , the most common example of a recursively deﬁned mathematical func-\\ntion is fibonacci , which has the following deﬁnition (see http://en.wikipedia.org/\\nwiki/Fibonacci_number ):\\nﬁbonacci (0) =0\\nﬁbonacci (1) =1\\nﬁbonacci (n) =ﬁbonacci (n−1) +ﬁbonacci (n−2)\\nTranslated into Python, it looks like this:', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 78}),\n",

But according to the leap of faith, if you assume that the two recursive calls work\\ncorrectly, then it is clear that you get the right result by adding them together.\\n6.8 Checking types\\nWhat happens if we call factorial and give it 1.5 as an argument?\\n>>> factorial(1.5)\\nRuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded\\nIt looks like an inﬁnite recursion. How can that be? The function has a base case—when n\\n== 0 . But if nis not an integer, we can miss the base case and recurse forever.\\nIn the ﬁrst recursive call, the value of nis 0.5. In the next, it is -0.5. From there, it gets\\nsmaller (more negative), but it will never be 0.\\nWe have two choices. We can try to generalize the factorial function to work with\\nﬂoating-point numbers, or we can make factorial check the type of its argument. The\\nﬁrst option is called the gamma function and it’s a little beyond the scope of this book. So\\nwe’ll go for the second.\\nWe can use the built-in function isinstance to verify the type of the argument.

In both\\ncases, the program prints an error message and returns None to indicate that something\\nwent wrong:\\n>>> print(factorial( 'fred '))\\nFactorial is only defined for integers.\\nNone\\n>>> print(factorial(-2))\\nFactorial is not defined for negative integers.\\nNone\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 79}),\n",

Or you can\\nwrite code that checks the preconditions explicitly.\\nIf the parameters look good, add a print statement before each return statement and\\ndisplay the return value. If possible, check the result by hand. Consider calling the function\\nwith values that make it easy to check the result (as in Section 6.2).\\nIf the function seems to be working, look at the function call to make sure the return value\\nis being used correctly (or used at all!).\\nAdding print statements at the beginning and end of a function can help make the ﬂow of\\nexecution more visible.

Because Python uses the\\nequal sign ( =) for assignment, it is tempting to interpret a statement like a = b as a mathe-\\nmatical proposition of equality; that is, the claim that aand bare equal. But this interpre-\\ntation is wrong.\\nFirst, equality is a symmetric relationship and assignment is not. For example, in math-\\nematics, if a=7 then 7 =a. But in Python, the statement a = 7 is legal and 7 = a is\\nnot.\\nAlso, in mathematics, a proposition of equality is either true or false for all time. If a=\\nbnow, then awill always equal b.

If the values of\\nvariables change frequently, it can make the code difﬁcult to read and debug.\\n7.2 Updating variables\\nA common kind of reassignment is an update , where the new value of the variable depends\\non the old.\\n>>> x = x + 1\\nThis means “get the current value of x, add one, and then update xwith the new value.”\\nIf you try to update a variable that doesn’t exist, you get an error, because Python evaluates\\nthe right side before it assigns a value to x:\\n>>> x = x + 1\\nNameError: name 'x'is not defined\\nBefore you can update a variable, you have to initialize it, usually with a simple assign-\\nment:\\n>>> x = 0\\n>>> x = x + 1\\nUpdating a variable by adding 1 is called an increment ; subtracting 1 is called a decrement .\\n7.3 The while statement\\nComputers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks\\nwithout making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly. In a\\ncomputer program, repetition is also called iteration .\\nWe have already seen two functions, countdown andprint_n , that iterate using recursion.\\nBecause iteration is so common, Python provides language features to make it easier.

When you get to 0, display the word\\nBlastoff! ”\\nMore formally, here is the ﬂow of execution for a while statement:\\n1. Determine whether the condition is true or false.\\n2. If false, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement.\\n3. If the condition is true, run the body and then go back to step 1.\\nThis type of ﬂow is called a loop because the third step loops back around to the top.\\nThe body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that the condition\\nbecomes false eventually and the loop terminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat forever,\\nwhich is called an inﬁnite loop . An endless source of amusement for computer scientists\\nis the observation that the directions on shampoo, “Lather, rinse, repeat”, are an inﬁnite\\nloop.\\nIn the case of countdown , we can prove that the loop terminates: if nis zero or negative, the\\nloop never runs.

              " Document(page_content='68 Chapter 7. Iteration\\nTo understand what an algorithm is, it might help to start with something that is not an\\nalgorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized\\nthe multiplication table. In effect, you memorized 100 speciﬁc solutions. That kind of\\nknowledge is not algorithmic.\\nBut if you were “lazy”, you might have learned a few tricks. For example, to ﬁnd the\\nproduct of nand 9, you can write n−1 as the ﬁrst digit and 10 −nas the second digit.\\nThis trick is a general solution for multiplying any single-digit number by 9. That’s an\\nalgorithm!\\nSimilarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrow-\\ning, and long division are all algorithms. One of the characteristics of algorithms is that\\nthey do not require any intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes where\\neach step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.\\nExecuting algorithms is boring, but designing them is interesting, intellectually challeng-\\ning, and a central part of computer science.\\nSome of the things that people do naturally, without difﬁculty or conscious thought, are\\nthe hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example.\\nWe all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain how we do it, at least not in the form\\nof an algorithm.\\n7.7 Debugging\\nAs you start writing bigger programs, you might ﬁnd yourself spending more time debug-\\nging. More code means more chances to make an error and more places for bugs to hide.\\nOne way to cut your debugging time is “debugging by bisection”. For example, if there\\nare 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.\\nInstead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for\\nan intermediate value you can check. Add a print statement (or something else that has a\\nveriﬁable effect) and run the program.\\nIf the mid-point check is incorrect, there must be a problem in the ﬁrst half of the program.\\nIf it is correct, the problem is in the second half.\\nEvery time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have to search.\\nAfter six steps (which is fewer than 100), you would be down to one or two lines of code,\\nat least in theory.\\nIn practice it is not always clear what the “middle of the program” is and not always pos-\\nsible to check it. It doesn’t make sense to count lines and ﬁnd the exact midpoint. Instead,\\nthink about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy\\nto put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that\\nthe bug is before or after the check.\\n7.8 Glossary\\nreassignment: Assigning a new value to a variable that already exists.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 89}),\n",

Since\\nwe started counting at zero, the six letters are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character,\\nyou have to subtract 1 from length :\\n>>> last = fruit[length-1]\\n>>> last\\n'a'\\nOr you can use negative indices, which count backward from the end of the string. The\\nexpression fruit[-1] yields the last letter, fruit[-2] yields the second to last, and so on.\\n8.3 Traversal with a forloop\\nA lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a time. Often they start\\nat the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the\\nend. This pattern of processing is called a traversal . One way to write a traversal is with a\\nwhile loop:\\nindex = 0\\nwhile index < len(fruit):\\nletter = fruit[index]\\nprint(letter)\\nindex = index + 1\\nThis loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by itself. The loop condition\\nisindex < len(fruit) , so when index is equal to the length of the string, the condition is\\nfalse, and the body of the loop doesn’t run. The last character accessed is the one with the\\nindex len(fruit)-1 , which is the last character in the string.\\nAs an exercise, write a function that takes a string as an argument and displays the letters\\nbackward, one per line.\\nAnother way to write a traversal is with a forloop:\\nfor letter in fruit:\\nprint(letter)\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 93}),\n",

In the Moby collection, the ﬁlename is 113809of.fic ; you can download a copy,\\nwith the simpler name words.txt , from https://thinkpython.com/code/words.txt .\\nThis ﬁle is in plain text, so you can open it with a text editor, but you can also read it from\\nPython. The built-in function open takes the name of the ﬁle as a parameter and returns a\\nﬁle object you can use to read the ﬁle.\\n>>> fin = open( 'words.txt ')\\nfin is a common name for a ﬁle object used for input. The ﬁle object provides several\\nmethods for reading, including readline , which reads characters from the ﬁle until it gets\\nto a newline and returns the result as a string:\\n>>> fin.readline()\\n'aa\\\\n '\\nThe ﬁrst word in this particular list is “aa”, which is a kind of lava. The sequence \\\\n\\nrepresents the newline character that separates this word from the next.\\nThe ﬁle object keeps track of where it is in the ﬁle, so if you call readline again, you get\\nthe next word:\\n>>> fin.readline()\\n'aah\\\\n '\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 104}),\n",

Can you ﬁnd a combination of 5 forbidden letters\\nthat excludes the smallest number of words?\\nExercise 9.4. Write a function named uses_only that takes a word and a string of letters, and\\nthat returns True if the word contains only letters in the list. Can you make a sentence using only\\nthe letters acefhlo ? Other than “Hoe alfalfa”?\\nExercise 9.5. Write a function named uses_all that takes a word and a string of required letters,\\nand that returns True if the word uses all the required letters at least once. How many words are\\nthere that use all the vowels aeiou ? How about aeiouy ?\\nExercise 9.6.

The simplest example is:\\ndef has_no_e(word):\\nfor letter in word:\\nif letter == 'e':\\nreturn False\\nreturn True\\nTheforloop traverses the characters in word . If we ﬁnd the letter “e”, we can immediately\\nreturn False ; otherwise we have to go to the next letter.

If we ﬁnd a letter in\\nword that is not in available , we can return False .\\nuses_all is similar except that we reverse the role of the word and the string of letters:\\ndef uses_all(word, required):\\nfor letter in required:\\nif letter not in word:\\nreturn False\\nreturn True\\nInstead of traversing the letters in word , the loop traverses the required letters. If any of the\\nrequired letters do not appear in the word, we can return False .\\nIf you were really thinking like a computer scientist, you would have recognized that\\nuses_all was an instance of a previously solved problem, and you would have written:\\ndef uses_all(word, required):\\nreturn uses_only(required, word)\\nThis is an example of a program development plan called reduction to a previously solved\\nproblem , which means that you recognize the problem you are working on as an instance\\nof a solved problem and apply an existing solution.\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 106}),\n",

Each time through the loop, it com-\\npares the ith character (which you can think of as the current character) to the i+1th\\ncharacter (which you can think of as the next).\\nIf the next character is less than (alphabetically before) the current one, then we have dis-\\ncovered a break in the abecedarian trend, and we return False .\\nIf we get to the end of the loop without ﬁnding a fault, then the word passes the test. To\\nconvince yourself that the loop ends correctly, consider an example like 'flossy '. The\\nlength of the word is 6, so the last time the loop runs is when iis 4, which is the index of\\nthe second-to-last character. On the last iteration, it compares the second-to-last character\\nto the last, which is what we want.\\nHere is a version of is_palindrome (see Exercise 6.3) that uses two indices; one starts at\\nthe beginning and goes up; the other starts at the end and goes down.\\ndef is_palindrome(word):\\ni = 0\\nj = len(word)-1\\nwhile i<j:\\nif word[i] != word[j]:\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 107}),\n",

The functions in this chapter are relatively easy to test because\\nyou can check the results by hand. Even so, it is somewhere between difﬁcult and impos-\\nsible to choose a set of words that test for all possible errors.\\nTaking has_no_e as an example, there are two obvious cases to check: words that have an\\n‘e’ should return False , and words that don’t should return True . You should have no\\ntrouble coming up with one of each.\\nWithin each case, there are some less obvious subcases. Among the words that have an\\n“e”, you should test words with an “e” at the beginning, the end, and somewhere in the\\nmiddle. You should test long words, short words, and very short words, like the empty\\nstring. The empty string is an example of a special case , which is one of the non-obvious\\ncases where errors often lurk.\\nIn addition to the test cases you generate, you can also test your program with a word list\\nlikewords.txt . By scanning the output, you might be able to catch errors, but be careful:\\nyou might catch one kind of error (words that should not be included, but are) and not\\nanother (words that should be included, but aren’t).\\nIn general, testing can help you ﬁnd bugs, but it is not easy to generate a good set of\\ntest cases, and even if you do, you can’t be sure your program is correct.

For example, delete_head removes the ﬁrst\\nelement from a list:\\ndef delete_head(t):\\ndel t[0]\\nHere’s how it is used:\\n>>> letters = [ 'a','b','c']\\n>>> delete_head(letters)\\n>>> letters\\n['b','c']\\nThe parameter tand the variable letters are aliases for the same object. The stack diagram\\nlooks like Figure 10.5.\\nSince the list is shared by two frames, I drew it between them.\\nIt is important to distinguish between operations that modify lists and operations that cre-\\nate new lists. For example, the append method modiﬁes a list, but the +operator creates a\\nnew list.\\nHere’s an example using append :\\n>>> t1 = [1, 2]\\n>>> t2 = t1.append(3)\\n>>> t1\\n[1, 2, 3]\\n>>> t2\\nNone\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 118}),\n",

Lists\\nThe return value from append isNone .\\nHere’s an example using the +operator:\\n>>> t3 = t1 + [4]\\n>>> t1\\n[1, 2, 3]\\n>>> t3\\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\\nThe result of the operator is a new list, and the original list is unchanged.\\nThis difference is important when you write functions that are supposed to modify lists.\\nFor example, this function does not delete the head of a list:\\ndef bad_delete_head(t):\\nt = t[1:] # WRONG!\\nThe slice operator creates a new list and the assignment makes trefer to it, but that doesn’t\\naffect the caller.\\n>>> t4 = [1, 2, 3]\\n>>> bad_delete_head(t4)\\n>>> t4\\n[1, 2, 3]\\nAt the beginning of bad_delete_head ,tand t4refer to the same list. At the end, trefers\\nto a new list, but t4still refers to the original, unmodiﬁed list.\\nAn alternative is to write a function that creates and returns a new list. For example, tail\\nreturns all but the ﬁrst element of a list:\\ndef tail(t):\\nreturn t[1:]\\nThis function leaves the original list unmodiﬁed. Here’s how it is used:\\n>>> letters = [ 'a','b','c']\\n>>> rest = tail(letters)\\n>>> rest\\n['b','c']\\n10.13 Debugging\\nCareless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging. Here\\nare some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:\\n1. Most list methods modify the argument and return None . This is the opposite of the\\nstring methods, which return a new string and leave the original alone.\\nIf you are used to writing string code like this:\\nword = word.strip()\\nIt is tempting to write list code like this:\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",

Debugging 99\\nt = t.sort() # WRONG!\\nBecause sort returns None , the next operation you perform with tis likely to fail.\\nBefore using list methods and operators, you should read the documentation care-\\nfully and then test them in interactive mode.\\n2. Pick an idiom and stick with it.\\nPart of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do things. For exam-\\nple, to remove an element from a list, you can use pop,remove ,del, or even a slice\\nassignment.\\nTo add an element, you can use the append method or the +operator. Assuming that\\ntis a list and xis a list element, these are correct:\\nt.append(x)\\nt = t + [x]\\nt += [x]\\nAnd these are wrong:\\nt.append([x]) # WRONG!\\nt = t.append(x) # WRONG!\\nt + [x] # WRONG!\\nt = t + x # WRONG!\\nTry out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure you understand\\nwhat they do. Notice that only the last one causes a runtime error; the other three are\\nlegal, but they do the wrong thing.\\n3. Make copies to avoid aliasing.\\nIf you want to use a method like sort that modiﬁes the argument, but you need to\\nkeep the original list as well, you can make a copy.\\n>>> t = [3, 1, 2]\\n>>> t2 = t[:]\\n>>> t2.sort()\\n>>> t\\n[3, 1, 2]\\n>>> t2\\n[1, 2, 3]\\nIn this example you could also use the built-in function sorted , which returns a new,\\nsorted list and leaves the original alone.\\n>>> t2 = sorted(t)\\n>>> t\\n[3, 1, 2]\\n>>> t2\\n[1, 2, 3]', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 120}),\n",

Dictionaries are one of\\nPython’s best features; they are the building blocks of many efﬁcient and elegant algo-\\nrithms.\\n11.1 A dictionary is a mapping\\nAdictionary is like a list, but more general. In a list, the indices have to be integers; in a\\ndictionary they can be (almost) any type.\\nA dictionary contains a collection of indices, which are called keys , and a collection of\\nvalues. Each key is associated with a single value. The association of a key and a value is\\ncalled a key-value pair or sometimes an item .\\nIn mathematical language, a dictionary represents a mapping from keys to values, so you\\ncan also say that each key “maps to” a value. As an example, we’ll build a dictionary that\\nmaps from English to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all strings.\\nThe function dict creates a new dictionary with no items. Because dict is the name of a\\nbuilt-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.\\n>>> eng2sp = dict()\\n>>> eng2sp\\n{}\\nThe squiggly-brackets, {}, represent an empty dictionary. To add items to the dictionary,\\nyou can use square brackets:\\n>>> eng2sp[ 'one'] = 'uno'\\nThis line creates an item that maps from the key 'one'to the value 'uno'. If we print the\\ndictionary again, we see a key-value pair with a colon between the key and value:\\n>>> eng2sp\\n{'one':'uno'}\\nThis output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary\\nwith three items:\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 124}),\n",

Dictionaries\\n>>> eng2sp = { 'one':'uno','two':'dos','three ':'tres '}\\nBut if you print eng2sp , you might be surprised:\\n>>> eng2sp\\n{'one':'uno','three ':'tres ','two':'dos'}\\nThe order of the key-value pairs might not be the same. If you type the same example\\non your computer, you might get a different result. In general, the order of items in a\\ndictionary is unpredictable.\\nBut that’s not a problem because the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with inte-\\nger indices. Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:\\n>>> eng2sp[ 'two']\\n'dos'\\nThe key 'two'always maps to the value 'dos'so the order of the items doesn’t matter.\\nIf the key isn’t in the dictionary, you get an exception:\\n>>> eng2sp[ 'four ']\\nKeyError: 'four '\\nThelenfunction works on dictionaries; it returns the number of key-value pairs:\\n>>> len(eng2sp)\\n3\\nTheinoperator works on dictionaries, too; it tells you whether something appears as a key\\nin the dictionary (appearing as a value is not good enough).\\n>>> 'one'in eng2sp\\nTrue\\n>>> 'uno'in eng2sp\\nFalse\\nTo see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you can use the method\\nvalues , which returns a collection of values, and then use the inoperator:\\n>>> vals = eng2sp.values()\\n>>> 'uno'in vals\\nTrue\\nTheinoperator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. For lists, it searches the\\nelements of the list in order, as in Section 8.6. As the list gets longer, the search time gets\\nlonger in direct proportion.\\nPython dictionaries use a data structure called a hashtable that has a remarkable property:\\ntheinoperator takes about the same amount of time no matter how many items are in the\\ndictionary. I explain how that’s possible in Section B.4, but the explanation might not make\\nsense until you’ve read a few more chapters.\\n11.2 Dictionary as a collection of counters\\nSuppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each letter appears.\\nThere are several ways you could do it:\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 125}),\n",

Then you could tra-\\nverse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, proba-\\nbly using a chained conditional.\\n2. You could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to\\na number (using the built-in function ord), use the number as an index into the list,\\nand increment the appropriate counter.\\n3. You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the correspond-\\ning values. The ﬁrst time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary.\\nAfter that you would increment the value of an existing item.\\nEach of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements that\\ncomputation in a different way.\\nAnimplementation is a way of performing a computation; some implementations are\\nbetter than others. For example, an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we\\ndon’t have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the string and we only have to\\nmake room for the letters that do appear.\\nHere is what the code might look like:\\ndef histogram(s):\\nd = dict()\\nfor c in s:\\nif c not in d:\\nd[c] = 1\\nelse:\\nd[c] += 1\\nreturn d\\nThe name of the function is histogram , which is a statistical term for a collection of counters\\n(or frequencies).\\nThe ﬁrst line of the function creates an empty dictionary. The forloop traverses the string.\\nEach time through the loop, if the character cis not in the dictionary, we create a new item\\nwith key cand the initial value 1 (since we have seen this letter once). If cis already in the\\ndictionary we increment d[c] .\\nHere’s how it works:\\n>>> h = histogram( 'brontosaurus ')\\n>>> h\\n{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'o': 2, 'n': 1, 's': 2, 'r': 2, 'u': 2, 't': 1}\\nThe histogram indicates that the letters 'a'and 'b'appear once; 'o'appears twice, and\\nso on.\\nDictionaries have a method called get that takes a key and a default value. If the key\\nappears in the dictionary, get returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the\\ndefault value. For example:\\n>>> h = histogram( 'a')\\n>>> h\\n{'a': 1}\\n>>> h.get( 'a', 0)\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",

This\\noperation is called a lookup .\\nBut what if you have vand you want to ﬁnd k? You have two problems: ﬁrst, there might\\nbe more than one key that maps to the value v. Depending on the application, you might\\nbe able to pick one, or you might have to make a list that contains all of them. Second,\\nthere is no simple syntax to do a reverse lookup ; you have to search.\\nHere is a function that takes a value and returns the ﬁrst key that maps to that value:\\ndef reverse_lookup(d, v):\\nfor k in d:\\nif d[k] == v:\\nreturn k\\nraise LookupError()\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 127}),\n",

The raise statement causes an exception; in this case it causes a\\nLookupError , which is a built-in exception used to indicate that a lookup operation failed.\\nIf we get to the end of the loop, that means vdoesn’t appear in the dictionary as a value, so\\nwe raise an exception.\\nHere is an example of a successful reverse lookup:\\n>>> h = histogram( \\'parrot \\')\\n>>> key = reverse_lookup(h, 2)\\n>>> key\\n\\'r\\'\\nAnd an unsuccessful one:\\n>>> key = reverse_lookup(h, 3)\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 5, in reverse_lookup\\nLookupError\\nThe effect when you raise an exception is the same as when Python raises one: it prints a\\ntraceback and an error message.\\nWhen you raise an exception, you can provide a detailed error message as an optional\\nargument.

For example, if you are given a dictionary that\\nmaps from letters to frequencies, you might want to invert it; that is, create a dictionary\\nthat maps from frequencies to letters.

But if the keys are mutable, like lists,\\nbad things happen. For example, when you create a key-value pair, Python hashes the key\\nand stores it in the corresponding location. If you modify the key and then hash it again, it\\nwould go to a different location. In that case you might have two entries for the same key,\\nor you might not be able to ﬁnd a key. Either way, the dictionary wouldn’t work correctly.\\nThat’s why keys have to be hashable, and why mutable types like lists aren’t.

Variables in __main__ are sometimes called global because they\\ncan be accessed from any function. Unlike local variables, which disappear when their\\nfunction ends, global variables persist from one function call to the next.\\nIt is common to use global variables for ﬂags ; that is, boolean variables that indicate (“ﬂag”)\\nwhether a condition is true.

Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:\\nScale down the input: If possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the pro-\\ngram reads a text ﬁle, start with just the ﬁrst 10 lines, or with the smallest example\\nyou can ﬁnd. You can either edit the ﬁles themselves, or (better) modify the program\\nso it reads only the ﬁrst nlines.\\nIf there is an error, you can reduce nto the smallest value that manifests the error, and\\nthen increase it gradually as you ﬁnd and correct errors.\\nCheck summaries and types: Instead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider\\nprinting summaries of the data: for example, the number of items in a dictionary or\\nthe total of a list of numbers.\\nA common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For debugging\\nthis kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.\\nWrite self-checks: Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For\\nexample, if you are computing the average of a list of numbers, you could check that\\nthe result is not greater than the largest element in the list or less than the smallest.\\nThis is called a “sanity check” because it detects results that are “insane”.\\nAnother kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see if\\nthey are consistent.

He came upon a common one-syllable,\\nﬁve-letter word recently that has the following unique property. When you remove the\\nﬁrst letter, the remaining letters form a homophone of the original word, that is a word\\nthat sounds exactly the same. Replace the ﬁrst letter, that is, put it back and remove\\nthe second letter and the result is yet another homophone of the original word.

It must have been a nine-pointer!’ It’s a perfect homophone. If you\\nput the ‘w’ back, and remove the ‘r,’ instead, you’re left with the word, ‘wack,’ which is\\na real word, it’s just not a homophone of the other two words.\\nBut there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of, which will yield two\\nhomophones if you remove either of the ﬁrst two letters to make two, new four-letter\\nwords. The question is, what’s the word?\\nYou can use the dictionary from Exercise 11.1 to check whether a string is in the word list.\\nTo check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU Pronouncing\\nDictionary.

If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an immutable type\\nlike a tuple or string.\\n3. If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the\\npotential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.\\nBecause tuples are immutable, they don’t provide methods like sort and reverse , which\\nmodify existing lists.

Determinism is usually a good thing, since we expect\\nthe same calculation to yield the same result. For some applications, though, we want the\\ncomputer to be unpredictable. Games are an obvious example, but there are more.\\nMaking a program truly nondeterministic turns out to be difﬁcult, but there are ways to\\nmake it at least seem nondeterministic. One of them is to use algorithms that generate\\npseudorandom numbers. Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random because they are\\ngenerated by a deterministic computation, but just by looking at the numbers it is all but\\nimpossible to distinguish them from random.\\nThe random module provides functions that generate pseudorandom numbers (which I\\nwill simply call “random” from here on).\\nThe function random returns a random ﬂoat between 0.0 and 1.0 (including 0.0 but not 1.0).\\nEach time you call random , you get the next number in a long series. To see a sample, run\\nthis loop:\\nimport random\\nfor i in range(10):\\nx = random.random()\\nprint(x)\\nThe function randint takes parameters lowand high and returns an integer between low\\nandhigh (including both).\\n>>> random.randint(5, 10)\\n5\\n>>> random.randint(5, 10)\\n9\\nTo choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use choice :\\n>>> t = [1, 2, 3]\\n>>> random.choice(t)\\n2\\n>>> random.choice(t)\\n3\\nThe random module also provides functions to generate random values from continuous\\ndistributions including Gaussian, exponential, gamma, and a few more.\\nExercise 13.5. Write a function named choose_from_hist that takes a histogram as deﬁned in\\nSection 11.2 and returns a random value from the histogram, chosen with probability in proportion\\nto frequency.

Markov analysis 131\\nthis the small regard harriet which knightley \\'s it most things\\nA series of random words seldom makes sense because there is no relationship between\\nsuccessive words. For example, in a real sentence you would expect an article like “the” to\\nbe followed by an adjective or a noun, and probably not a verb or adverb.\\nOne way to measure these kinds of relationships is Markov analysis, which characterizes,\\nfor a given sequence of words, the probability of the words that might come next. For\\nexample, the song Eric, the Half a Bee begins:\\nHalf a bee, philosophically,\\nMust, ipso facto, half not be.\\nBut half the bee has got to be\\nVis a vis, its entity. D’you see?\\nBut can a bee be said to be\\nOr not to be an entire bee\\nWhen half the bee is not a bee\\nDue to some ancient injury?\\nIn this text, the phrase “half the” is always followed by the word “bee”, but the phrase “the\\nbee” might be followed by either “has” or “is”.\\nThe result of Markov analysis is a mapping from each preﬁx (like “half the” and “the bee”)\\nto all possible sufﬁxes (like “has” and “is”).\\nGiven this mapping, you can generate a random text by starting with any preﬁx and choos-\\ning at random from the possible sufﬁxes. Next, you can combine the end of the preﬁx and\\nthe new sufﬁx to form the next preﬁx, and repeat.\\nFor example, if you start with the preﬁx “Half a”, then the next word has to be “bee”,\\nbecause the preﬁx only appears once in the text. The next preﬁx is “a bee”, so the next\\nsufﬁx might be “philosophically”, “be” or “due”.\\nIn this example the length of the preﬁx is always two, but you can do Markov analysis with\\nany preﬁx length.\\nExercise 13.8. Markov analysis:\\n1. Write a program to read a text from a ﬁle and perform Markov analysis. The result should be\\na dictionary that maps from preﬁxes to a collection of possible sufﬁxes. The collection might\\nbe a list, tuple, or dictionary; it is up to you to make an appropriate choice. You can test your\\nprogram with preﬁx length two, but you should write the program in a way that makes it easy\\nto try other lengths.\\n2. Add a function to the previous program to generate random text based on the Markov analysis.\\nHere is an example from Emma with preﬁx length 2:\\nHe was very clever, be it sweetness or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such\\na stroke. She had never thought of Hannah till you were never meant for me?\" \"I\\ncannot make speeches, Emma:\" he soon cut it all himself.\\nFor this example, I left the punctuation attached to the words. The result is almost syntacti-\\ncally correct, but not quite. Semantically, it almost makes sense, but not quite.\\nWhat happens if you increase the preﬁx length?

In your solution to the previous exercises, you had to\\nchoose:\\n• How to represent the preﬁxes.\\n• How to represent the collection of possible sufﬁxes.\\n• How to represent the mapping from each preﬁx to the collection of possible sufﬁxes.\\nThe last one is easy: a dictionary is the obvious choice for a mapping from keys to corre-\\nsponding values.\\nFor the preﬁxes, the most obvious options are string, list of strings, or tuple of strings.\\nFor the sufﬁxes, one option is a list; another is a histogram (dictionary).\\nHow should you choose? The ﬁrst step is to think about the operations you will need to\\nimplement for each data structure. For the preﬁxes, we need to be able to remove words\\nfrom the beginning and add to the end. For example, if the current preﬁx is “Half a”, and\\nthe next word is “bee”, you need to be able to form the next preﬁx, “a bee”.\\nYour ﬁrst choice might be a list, since it is easy to add and remove elements, but we also\\nneed to be able to use the preﬁxes as keys in a dictionary, so that rules out lists. With tuples,\\nyou can’t append or remove, but you can use the addition operator to form a new tuple:\\ndef shift(prefix, word):\\nreturn prefix[1:] + (word,)\\nshift takes a tuple of words, prefix , and a string, word , and forms a new tuple that has\\nall the words in prefix except the ﬁrst, and word added to the end.\\nFor the collection of sufﬁxes, the operations we need to perform include adding a new\\nsufﬁx (or increasing the frequency of an existing one), and choosing a random sufﬁx.\\nAdding a new sufﬁx is equally easy for the list implementation or the histogram. Choosing\\na random element from a list is easy; choosing from a histogram is harder to do efﬁciently\\n(see Exercise 13.7).\\nSo far we have been talking mostly about ease of implementation, but there are other fac-\\ntors to consider in choosing data structures. One is run time. Sometimes there is a theoreti-\\ncal reason to expect one data structure to be faster than other; for example, I mentioned that', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 153}),\n",

Debugging 133\\ntheinoperator is faster for dictionaries than for lists, at least when the number of elements\\nis large.\\nBut often you don’t know ahead of time which implementation will be faster. One option is\\nto implement both of them and see which is better. This approach is called benchmarking .\\nA practical alternative is to choose the data structure that is easiest to implement, and then\\nsee if it is fast enough for the intended application. If so, there is no need to go on. If not,\\nthere are tools, like the profile module, that can identify the places in a program that take\\nthe most time.\\nThe other factor to consider is storage space. For example, using a histogram for the col-\\nlection of sufﬁxes might take less space because you only have to store each word once, no\\nmatter how many times it appears in the text. In some cases, saving space can also make\\nyour program run faster, and in the extreme, your program might not run at all if you run\\nout of memory. But for many applications, space is a secondary consideration after run\\ntime.\\nOne ﬁnal thought: in this discussion, I have implied that we should use one data structure\\nfor both analysis and generation. But since these are separate phases, it would also be pos-\\nsible to use one structure for analysis and then convert to another structure for generation.\\nThis would be a net win if the time saved during generation exceeded the time spent in\\nconversion.\\n13.10 Debugging\\nWhen you are debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a hard bug,\\nthere are ﬁve things to try:\\nReading: Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says what you\\nmeant to say.\\nRunning: Experiment by making changes and running different versions. Often if you\\ndisplay the right thing at the right place in the program, the problem becomes obvi-\\nous, but sometimes you have to build scaffolding.\\nRuminating: Take some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime, or seman-\\ntic? What information can you get from the error messages, or from the output of the\\nprogram? What kind of error could cause the problem you’re seeing? What did you\\nchange last, before the problem appeared?\\nRubberducking: If you explain the problem to someone else, you sometimes ﬁnd the\\nanswer before you ﬁnish asking the question. Often you don’t need the other\\nperson; you could just talk to a rubber duck. And that’s the origin of the well-\\nknown strategy called rubber duck debugging . I am not making this up; see\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging .\\nRetreating: At some point, the best thing to do is back off, undoing recent changes, until\\nyou get back to a program that works and that you understand.

Each activity comes with its own failure mode.\\nFor example, reading your code might help if the problem is a typographical error, but\\nnot if the problem is a conceptual misunderstanding. If you don’t understand what your\\nprogram does, you can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in\\nyour head.\\nRunning experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests. But if you run\\nexperiments without thinking or reading your code, you might fall into a pattern I call\\n“random walk programming”, which is the process of making random changes until the\\nprogram does the right thing. Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long\\ntime.\\nYou have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental science. You should have\\nat least one hypothesis about what the problem is. If there are two or more possibilities, try\\nto think of a test that would eliminate one of them.\\nBut even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many errors, or if the code\\nyou are trying to ﬁx is too big and complicated. Sometimes the best option is to retreat,\\nsimplifying the program until you get to something that works and that you understand.\\nBeginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they can’t stand to delete a\\nline of code (even if it’s wrong). If it makes you feel better, copy your program into another\\nﬁle before you start stripping it down.

In this exam-\\nple, the except clause prints an error message that is not very helpful. In general, catching\\nan exception gives you a chance to ﬁx the problem, or try again, or at least end the program\\ngracefully.\\n14.6 Databases\\nAdatabase is a ﬁle that is organized for storing data. Many databases are organized like a\\ndictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference between\\na database and a dictionary is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so\\nit persists after the program ends.\\nThe module dbm provides an interface for creating and updating database ﬁles. As an\\nexample, I’ll create a database that contains captions for image ﬁles.\\nOpening a database is similar to opening other ﬁles:\\n>>> import dbm\\n>>> db = dbm.open( 'captions ','c')\\nThe mode 'c'means that the database should be created if it doesn’t already exist. The\\nresult is a database object that can be used (for most operations) like a dictionary.\\nWhen you create a new item, dbmupdates the database ﬁle.\\n>>> db[ 'cleese.png '] = 'Photo of John Cleese. '\\nWhen you access one of the items, dbmreads the ﬁle:\\n>>> db[ 'cleese.png ']\\nb'Photo of John Cleese. '\\nThe result is a bytes object , which is why it begins with b. A bytes object is similar to a\\nstring in many ways. When you get farther into Python, the difference becomes important,\\nbut for now we can ignore it.\\nIf you make another assignment to an existing key, dbmreplaces the old value:\\n>>> db[ 'cleese.png '] = 'Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk. '\\n>>> db[ 'cleese.png ']\\nb'Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk. '\\nSome dictionary methods, like keys and items , don’t work with database objects. But\\niteration with a forloop works:\\nfor key in db.keys():\\nprint(key, db[key])\\nAs with other ﬁles, you should close the database when you are done:\\n>>> db.close()\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 162}),\n",

Shells\\nusually provide commands to navigate the ﬁle system and launch applications. For exam-\\nple, in Unix you can change directories with cd, display the contents of a directory with ls,\\nand launch a web browser by typing (for example) firefox .\\nAny program that you can launch from the shell can also be launched from Python using\\napipe object , which represents a running program.\\nFor example, the Unix command ls -l normally displays the contents of the current di-\\nrectory in long format. You can launch lswith os.popen1:\\n>>> cmd = 'ls -l '\\n>>> fp = os.popen(cmd)\\n1popen is deprecated now, which means we are supposed to stop using it and start using the subprocess\\nmodule.

If the program is running\\nas a script, __name__ has the value '__main__ '; in that case, the test code runs. Otherwise,\\nif the module is being imported, the test code is skipped.\\nAs an exercise, type this example into a ﬁle named wc.py and run it as a script. Then run\\nthe Python interpreter and import wc . What is the value of __name__ when the module is\\nbeing imported?\\nWarning: If you import a module that has already been imported, Python does nothing. It\\ndoes not re-read the ﬁle, even if it has changed.\\nIf you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function reload , but it can be\\ntricky, so the safest thing to do is restart the interpreter and then import the module again.\\n14.10 Debugging\\nWhen you are reading and writing ﬁles, you might run into problems with whitespace.\\nThese errors can be hard to debug because spaces, tabs and newlines are normally invisible:\\n>>> s = '1 2\\\\t 3\\\\n 4 '\\n>>> print(s)\\n1 2 3\\n4\\nThe built-in function repr can help.

As\\nan example, we will create a type called Point that represents a point in two-dimensional\\nspace.\\nIn mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating\\nthe coordinates. For example, (0, 0)represents the origin, and (x,y)represents the point x\\nunits to the right and yunits up from the origin.\\nThere are several ways we might represent points in Python:\\n• We could store the coordinates separately in two variables, xandy.\\n• We could store the coordinates as elements in a list or tuple.\\n• We could create a new type to represent points as objects.\\nCreating a new type is more complicated than the other options, but it has advantages that\\nwill be apparent soon.\\nA programmer-deﬁned type is also called a class .

In that case, you will be disappointed to learn that for instances, the default\\nbehavior of the ==operator is the same as the isoperator; it checks object identity, not\\nobject equivalence.

Functions that work this way are called modiﬁers .\\nincrement , which adds a given number of seconds to a Time object, can be written naturally\\nas a modiﬁer.

As an exercise, write a correct\\nversion of increment that doesn’t contain any loops.\\nAnything that can be done with modiﬁers can also be done with pure functions. In fact,\\nsome programming languages only allow pure functions. There is some evidence that\\nprograms that use pure functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than programs\\nthat use modiﬁers.

For each func-\\ntion, I wrote a prototype that performed the basic calculation and then tested it, patching\\nerrors along the way.\\nThis approach can be effective, especially if you don’t yet have a deep understanding\\nof the problem. But incremental corrections can generate code that is unnecessarily\\ncomplicated—since it deals with many special cases—and unreliable—since it is hard to\\nknow if you have found all the errors.\\nAn alternative is designed development , in which high-level insight into the problem can\\nmake the programming much easier. In this case, the insight is that a Time object is really\\na three-digit number in base 60 (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal ). The\\nsecond attribute is the “ones column”, the minute attribute is the “sixties column”, and the\\nhour attribute is the “thirty-six hundreds column”.\\nWhen we wrote add_time and increment , we were effectively doing addition in base 60,\\nwhich is why we had to carry from one column to the next.\\nThis observation suggests another approach to the whole problem—we can convert Time\\nobjects to integers and take advantage of the fact that the computer knows how to do\\ninteger arithmetic.\\nHere is a function that converts Times to integers:\\ndef time_to_int(time):\\nminutes = time.hour * 60 + time.minute\\nseconds = minutes * 60 + time.second\\nreturn seconds\\nAnd here is a function that converts an integer to a Time (recall that divmod divides the ﬁrst\\nargument by the second and returns the quotient and remainder as a tuple).\\ndef int_to_time(seconds):\\ntime = Time()\\nminutes, time.second = divmod(seconds, 60)\\ntime.hour, time.minute = divmod(minutes, 60)\\nreturn time\\nYou might have to think a bit, and run some tests, to convince yourself that these functions\\nare correct. One way to test them is to check that time_to_int(int_to_time(x)) == x for\\nmany values of x. This is an example of a consistency check.\\nOnce you are convinced they are correct, you can use them to rewrite add_time :\\ndef add_time(t1, t2):\\nseconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)\\nreturn int_to_time(seconds)', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 179}),\n",

As an exercise, rewrite\\nincrement using time_to_int andint_to_time .\\nIn some ways, converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder than just dealing with\\ntimes. Base conversion is more abstract; our intuition for dealing with time values is better.\\nBut if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers and make the investment of\\nwriting the conversion functions ( time_to_int and int_to_time ), we get a program that\\nis shorter, easier to read and debug, and more reliable.\\nIt is also easier to add features later. For example, imagine subtracting two Times to ﬁnd\\nthe duration between them. The naive approach would be to implement subtraction with\\nborrowing.

The next\\nstep is to transform those functions into methods that make the relationships explicit.\\nCode examples from this chapter are available from https://thinkpython.com/code/\\nTime2.py , and solutions to the exercises are in https://thinkpython.com/code/Point2_\\nsoln.py .\\n17.1 Object-oriented features\\nPython is an object-oriented programming language , which means that it provides fea-\\ntures that support object-oriented programming, which has these deﬁning characteristics:\\n• Programs include class and method deﬁnitions.\\n• Most of the computation is expressed in terms of operations on objects.\\n• Objects often represent things in the real world, and methods often correspond to the\\nways things in the real world interact.\\nFor example, the Time class deﬁned in Chapter 16 corresponds to the way people record\\nthe time of day, and the functions we deﬁned correspond to the kinds of things people do\\nwith times. Similarly, the Point and Rectangle classes in Chapter 15 correspond to the\\nmathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle.\\nSo far, we have not taken advantage of the features Python provides to support object-\\noriented programming. These features are not strictly necessary; most of them provide\\nalternative syntax for things we have already done. But in many cases, the alternative is\\nmore concise and more accurately conveys the structure of the program.\\nFor example, in Time1.py there is no obvious connection between the class deﬁnition and\\nthe function deﬁnitions that follow. With some examination, it is apparent that every func-\\ntion takes at least one Time object as an argument.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 182}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='162 Chapter 17. Classes and methods\\nThis observation is the motivation for methods ; a method is a function that is associated\\nwith a particular class. We have seen methods for strings, lists, dictionaries and tuples. In\\nthis chapter, we will deﬁne methods for programmer-deﬁned types.\\nMethods are semantically the same as functions, but there are two syntactic differences:\\n• Methods are deﬁned inside a class deﬁnition in order to make the relationship be-\\ntween the class and the method explicit.\\n• The syntax for invoking a method is different from the syntax for calling a function.\\nIn the next few sections, we will take the functions from the previous two chapters and\\ntransform them into methods. This transformation is purely mechanical; you can do it by\\nfollowing a sequence of steps. If you are comfortable converting from one form to another,\\nyou will be able to choose the best form for whatever you are doing.\\n17.2 Printing objects\\nIn Chapter 16, we deﬁned a class named Time and in Section 16.1, you wrote a function\\nnamed print_time :\\nclass Time:\\n\"\"\"Represents the time of day.\"\"\"\\ndef print_time(time):\\nprint( \\'%.2d:%.2d:%.2d \\'% (time.hour, time.minute, time.second))\\nTo call this function, you have to pass a Time object as an argument:\\n>>> start = Time()\\n>>> start.hour = 9\\n>>> start.minute = 45\\n>>> start.second = 00\\n>>> print_time(start)\\n09:45:00\\nTo make print_time a method, all we have to do is move the function deﬁnition inside the\\nclass deﬁnition. Notice the change in indentation.\\nclass Time:\\ndef print_time(time):\\nprint( \\'%.2d:%.2d:%.2d \\'% (time.hour, time.minute, time.second))\\nNow there are two ways to call print_time . The ﬁrst (and less common) way is to use\\nfunction syntax:\\n>>> Time.print_time(start)\\n09:45:00\\nIn this use of dot notation, Time is the name of the class, and print_time is the name of the\\nmethod. start is passed as a parameter.\\nThe second (and more concise) way is to use method syntax:\\n>>> start.print_time()\\n09:45:00', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 183}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"17.3. Another example 163\\nIn this use of dot notation, print_time is the name of the method (again), and start is\\nthe object the method is invoked on, which is called the subject . Just as the subject of\\na sentence is what the sentence is about, the subject of a method invocation is what the\\nmethod is about.\\nInside the method, the subject is assigned to the ﬁrst parameter, so in this case start is\\nassigned to time .\\nBy convention, the ﬁrst parameter of a method is called self , so it would be more common\\nto write print_time like this:\\nclass Time:\\ndef print_time(self):\\nprint( '%.2d:%.2d:%.2d '% (self.hour, self.minute, self.second))\\nThe reason for this convention is an implicit metaphor:\\n• The syntax for a function call, print_time(start) , suggests that the function is the\\nactive agent. It says something like, “Hey print_time ! Here’s an object for you to\\nprint.”\\n• In object-oriented programming, the objects are the active agents. A method invoca-\\ntion like start.print_time() says “Hey start ! Please print yourself.”\\nThis change in perspective might be more polite, but it is not obvious that it is useful. In the\\nexamples we have seen so far, it may not be. But sometimes shifting responsibility from the\\nfunctions onto the objects makes it possible to write more versatile functions (or methods),\\nand makes it easier to maintain and reuse code.\\nAs an exercise, rewrite time_to_int (from Section 16.4) as a method. You might be tempted\\nto rewrite int_to_time as a method, too, but that doesn’t really make sense because there\\nwould be no object to invoke it on.\\n17.3 Another example\\nHere’s a version of increment (from Section 16.3) rewritten as a method:\\n# inside class Time:\\ndef increment(self, seconds):\\nseconds += self.time_to_int()\\nreturn int_to_time(seconds)\\nThis version assumes that time_to_int is written as a method. Also, note that it is a pure\\nfunction, not a modiﬁer.\\nHere’s how you would invoke increment :\\n>>> start.print_time()\\n09:45:00\\n>>> end = start.increment(1337)\\n>>> end.print_time()\\n10:07:17\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 184}),\n",

The argument, 1337 , gets\\nassigned to the second parameter, seconds .\\nThis mechanism can be confusing, especially if you make an error. For example, if you\\ninvoke increment with two arguments, you get:\\n>>> end = start.increment(1337, 460)\\nTypeError: increment() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given\\nThe error message is initially confusing, because there are only two arguments in paren-\\ntheses. But the subject is also considered an argument, so all together that’s three.\\nBy the way, a positional argument is an argument that doesn’t have a parameter name;\\nthat is, it is not a keyword argument. In this function call:\\nsketch(parrot, cage, dead=True)\\nparrot andcage are positional, and dead is a keyword argument.\\n17.4 A more complicated example\\nRewriting is_after (from Section 16.1) is slightly more complicated because it takes two\\nTime objects as parameters. In this case it is conventional to name the ﬁrst parameter self\\nand the second parameter other :\\n# inside class Time:\\ndef is_after(self, other):\\nreturn self.time_to_int() > other.time_to_int()\\nTo use this method, you have to invoke it on one object and pass the other as an argument:\\n>>> end.is_after(start)\\nTrue\\nOne nice thing about this syntax is that it almost reads like English: “end is after start?”\\n17.5 The init method\\nThe init method (short for “initialization”) is a special method that gets invoked when an\\nobject is instantiated. Its full name is __init__ (two underscore characters, followed by\\ninit , and then two more underscores).

It is considered a good idea to initialize all of an object’s attributes in the init\\nmethod.\\nIf you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you can use the built-in\\nfunction hasattr (see Section 15.7).\\nAnother way to access attributes is the built-in function vars , which takes an object and\\nreturns a dictionary that maps from attribute names (as strings) to their values:\\n>>> p = Point(3, 4)\\n>>> vars(p)\\n{'y': 4, 'x': 3}\\nFor purposes of debugging, you might ﬁnd it useful to keep this function handy:\\ndef print_attributes(obj):\\nfor attr in vars(obj):\\nprint(attr, getattr(obj, attr))\\nprint_attributes traverses the dictionary and prints each attribute name and its corre-\\nsponding value.\\nThe built-in function getattr takes an object and an attribute name (as a string) and returns\\nthe attribute’s value.\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 189}),\n",

For objects, that means that the methods a class provides should not depend\\non how the attributes are represented.\\nFor example, in this chapter we developed a class that represents a time of day. Methods\\nprovided by this class include time_to_int ,is_after , and add_time .\\nWe could implement those methods in several ways.

In this chapter, the attributes of a Time object are hour ,\\nminute , and second .\\nAs an alternative, we could replace these attributes with a single integer representing the\\nnumber of seconds since midnight. This implementation would make some methods, like\\nis_after , easier to write, but it makes other methods harder.\\nAfter you deploy a new class, you might discover a better implementation. If other parts\\nof the program are using your class, it might be time-consuming and error-prone to change\\nthe interface.\\nBut if you designed the interface carefully, you can change the implementation without\\nchanging the interface, which means that other parts of the program don’t have to change.\\n17.12 Glossary\\nobject-oriented language: A language that provides features, such as programmer-\\ndeﬁned types and methods, that facilitate object-oriented programming.\\nobject-oriented programming: A style of programming in which data and the operations\\nthat manipulate it are organized into classes and methods.\\nmethod: A function that is deﬁned inside a class deﬁnition and is invoked on instances of\\nthat class.\\nsubject: The object a method is invoked on.\\npositional argument: An argument that does not include a parameter name, so it is not a\\nkeyword argument.\\noperator overloading: Changing the behavior of an operator like +so it works with a\\nprogrammer-deﬁned type.\\ntype-based dispatch: A programming pattern that checks the type of an operand and in-\\nvokes different functions for different types.\\npolymorphic: Pertaining to a function that can work with more than one type.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 190}),\n",

              " Document(page_content=\"Chapter 18\\nInheritance\\nThe language feature most often associated with object-oriented programming is inheri-\\ntance . Inheritance is the ability to deﬁne a new class that is a modiﬁed version of an ex-\\nisting class. In this chapter I demonstrate inheritance using classes that represent playing\\ncards, decks of cards, and poker hands.\\nIf you don’t play poker, you can read about it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker ,\\nbut you don’t have to; I’ll tell you what you need to know for the exercises.\\nCode examples from this chapter are available from https://thinkpython.com/code/\\nCard.py .\\n18.1 Card objects\\nThere are ﬁfty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one of\\nthirteen ranks. The suits are Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (in descending order in\\nbridge). The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on\\nthe game that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2.\\nIf we want to deﬁne a new object to represent a playing card, it is obvious what the at-\\ntributes should be: rank andsuit . It is not as obvious what type the attributes should be.\\nOne possibility is to use strings containing words like 'Spade 'for suits and 'Queen 'for\\nranks. One problem with this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards\\nto see which had a higher rank or suit.\\nAn alternative is to use integers to encode the ranks and suits. In this context, “encode”\\nmeans that we are going to deﬁne a mapping between numbers and suits, or between\\nnumbers and ranks. This kind of encoding is not meant to be a secret (that would be\\n“encryption”).\\nFor example, this table shows the suits and the corresponding integer codes:\\nSpades↦→ 3\\nHearts↦→ 2\\nDiamonds↦→ 1\\nClubs↦→ 0\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 192}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='172 Chapter 18. Inheritance\\nThis code makes it easy to compare cards; because higher suits map to higher numbers, we\\ncan compare suits by comparing their codes.\\nThe mapping for ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks maps to the corre-\\nsponding integer, and for face cards:\\nJack↦→ 11\\nQueen↦→ 12\\nKing↦→ 13\\nI am using the↦→symbol to make it clear that these mappings are not part of the Python\\nprogram. They are part of the program design, but they don’t appear explicitly in the code.\\nThe class deﬁnition for Card looks like this:\\nclass Card:\\n\"\"\"Represents a standard playing card.\"\"\"\\ndef __init__(self, suit=0, rank=2):\\nself.suit = suit\\nself.rank = rank\\nAs usual, the init method takes an optional parameter for each attribute. The default card\\nis the 2 of Clubs.\\nTo create a Card, you call Card with the suit and rank of the card you want.\\nqueen_of_diamonds = Card(1, 12)\\n18.2 Class attributes\\nIn order to print Card objects in a way that people can easily read, we need a mapping\\nfrom the integer codes to the corresponding ranks and suits. A natural way to do that is\\nwith lists of strings. We assign these lists to class attributes :\\n# inside class Card:\\nsuit_names = [ \\'Clubs \\',\\'Diamonds \\',\\'Hearts \\',\\'Spades \\']\\nrank_names = [None, \\'Ace\\',\\'2\\',\\'3\\',\\'4\\',\\'5\\',\\'6\\',\\'7\\',\\n\\'8\\',\\'9\\',\\'10\\',\\'Jack \\',\\'Queen \\',\\'King \\']\\ndef __str__(self):\\nreturn \\'%s of %s \\'% (Card.rank_names[self.rank],\\nCard.suit_names[self.suit])\\nVariables like suit_names and rank_names , which are deﬁned inside a class but outside\\nof any method, are called class attributes because they are associated with the class object\\nCard .\\nThis term distinguishes them from variables like suit andrank , which are called instance\\nattributes because they are associated with a particular instance.\\nBoth kinds of attribute are accessed using dot notation. For example, in __str__ ,self\\nis a Card object, and self.rank is its rank. Similarly, Card is a class object, and\\nCard.rank_names is a list of strings associated with the class.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 193}),\n",

By includ-\\ningNone as a place-keeper, we get a mapping with the nice property that the index 2 maps\\nto the string '2', and so on.

For programmer-deﬁned\\ntypes, we can override the behavior of the built-in operators by providing a method named\\n__lt__ , which stands for “less than”.\\n__lt__ takes two parameters, self andother , and returns True ifself is strictly less than\\nother .\\nThe correct ordering for cards is not obvious. For example, which is better, the 3 of Clubs\\nor the 2 of Diamonds? One has a higher rank, but the other has a higher suit. In order to\\ncompare cards, you have to decide whether rank or suit is more important.\\nThe answer might depend on what game you are playing, but to keep things simple, we’ll\\nmake the arbitrary choice that suit is more important, so all of the Spades outrank all of the\\nDiamonds, and so on.\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 194}),\n",

You can use tuple comparison,\\nbut you also might consider comparing integers.\\n18.4 Decks\\nNow that we have Cards, the next step is to deﬁne Decks. Since a deck is made up of cards,\\nit is natural for each Deck to contain a list of cards as an attribute.\\nThe following is a class deﬁnition for Deck . The init method creates the attribute cards and\\ngenerates the standard set of ﬁfty-two cards:\\nclass Deck:\\ndef __init__(self):\\nself.cards = []\\nfor suit in range(4):\\nfor rank in range(1, 14):\\ncard = Card(suit, rank)\\nself.cards.append(card)\\nThe easiest way to populate the deck is with a nested loop. The outer loop enumerates the\\nsuits from 0 to 3. The inner loop enumerates the ranks from 1 to 13. Each iteration creates\\na new Card with the current suit and rank, and appends it to self.cards .\\n18.5 Printing the deck\\nHere is a __str__ method for Deck :\\n# inside class Deck:\\ndef __str__(self):\\nres = []', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 195}),\n",

The built-in function str invokes the\\n__str__ method on each card and returns the string representation.\\nSince we invoke join on a newline character, the cards are separated by newlines. Here’s\\nwhat the result looks like:\\n>>> deck = Deck()\\n>>> print(deck)\\nAce of Clubs\\n2 of Clubs\\n3 of Clubs\\n...\\n10 of Spades\\nJack of Spades\\nQueen of Spades\\nKing of Spades\\nEven though the result appears on 52 lines, it is one long string that contains newlines.\\n18.6 Add, remove, shufﬂe and sort\\nTo deal cards, we would like a method that removes a card from the deck and returns it.\\nThe list method popprovides a convenient way to do that:\\n# inside class Deck:\\ndef pop_card(self):\\nreturn self.cards.pop()\\nSince popremoves the lastcard in the list, we are dealing from the bottom of the deck.\\nTo add a card, we can use the list method append :\\n# inside class Deck:\\ndef add_card(self, card):\\nself.cards.append(card)\\nA method like this that uses another method without doing much work is sometimes called\\naveneer . The metaphor comes from woodworking, where a veneer is a thin layer of good\\nquality wood glued to the surface of a cheaper piece of wood to improve the appearance.\\nIn this case add_card is a “thin” method that expresses a list operation in terms appropriate\\nfor decks. It improves the appearance, or interface, of the implementation.\\nAs another example, we can write a Deck method named shuffle using the function\\nshuffle from the random module:\\n# inside class Deck:\\ndef shuffle(self):\\nrandom.shuffle(self.cards)\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 196}),\n",

A hand is similar to a deck: both are made up of a collection of cards, and both\\nrequire operations like adding and removing cards.\\nA hand is also different from a deck; there are operations we want for hands that don’t\\nmake sense for a deck. For example, in poker we might compare two hands to see which\\none wins. In bridge, we might compute a score for a hand in order to make a bid.\\nThis relationship between classes—similar, but different—lends itself to inheritance. To\\ndeﬁne a new class that inherits from an existing class, you put the name of the existing\\nclass in parentheses:\\nclass Hand(Deck):\\n\"\"\"Represents a hand of playing cards.\"\"\"\\nThis deﬁnition indicates that Hand inherits from Deck ; that means we can use methods like\\npop_card andadd_card for Hands as well as Decks.\\nWhen a new class inherits from an existing one, the existing one is called the parent and\\nthe new class is called the child .\\nIn this example, Hand inherits __init__ from Deck , but it doesn’t really do what we want:\\ninstead of populating the hand with 52 new cards, the init method for Hands should ini-\\ntialize cards with an empty list.\\nIf we provide an init method in the Hand class, it overrides the one in the Deck class:\\n# inside class Hand:\\ndef __init__(self, label= \\'\\'):\\nself.cards = []\\nself.label = label\\nWhen you create a Hand, Python invokes this init method, not the one in Deck .\\n>>> hand = Hand( \\'new hand \\')\\n>>> hand.cards\\n[]\\n>>> hand.label\\n\\'new hand \\'\\nThe other methods are inherited from Deck , so we can use pop_card andadd_card to deal\\na card:\\n>>> deck = Deck()\\n>>> card = deck.pop_card()\\n>>> hand.add_card(card)\\n>>> print(hand)\\nKing of Spades', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 197}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='18.8. Class diagrams 177\\nA natural next step is to encapsulate this code in a method called move_cards :\\n# inside class Deck:\\ndef move_cards(self, hand, num):\\nfor i in range(num):\\nhand.add_card(self.pop_card())\\nmove_cards takes two arguments, a Hand object and the number of cards to deal. It modi-\\nﬁes both self andhand , and returns None .\\nIn some games, cards are moved from one hand to another, or from a hand back to the\\ndeck. You can use move_cards for any of these operations: self can be either a Deck or a\\nHand, and hand , despite the name, can also be a Deck .\\nInheritance is a useful feature. Some programs that would be repetitive without inheritance\\ncan be written more elegantly with it. Inheritance can facilitate code reuse, since you can\\ncustomize the behavior of parent classes without having to modify them. In some cases,\\nthe inheritance structure reﬂects the natural structure of the problem, which makes the\\ndesign easier to understand.\\nOn the other hand, inheritance can make programs difﬁcult to read. When a method is\\ninvoked, it is sometimes not clear where to ﬁnd its deﬁnition. The relevant code may be\\nspread across several modules. Also, many of the things that can be done using inheritance\\ncan be done as well or better without it.\\n18.8 Class diagrams\\nSo far we have seen stack diagrams, which show the state of a program, and object dia-\\ngrams, which show the attributes of an object and their values. These diagrams represent\\na snapshot in the execution of a program, so they change as the program runs.\\nThey are also highly detailed; for some purposes, too detailed. A class diagram is a more\\nabstract representation of the structure of a program. Instead of showing individual ob-\\njects, it shows classes and the relationships between them.\\nThere are several kinds of relationship between classes:\\n• Objects in one class might contain references to objects in another class. For example,\\neach Rectangle contains a reference to a Point, and each Deck contains references to\\nmany Cards. This kind of relationship is called HAS-A , as in, “a Rectangle has a\\nPoint.”\\n• One class might inherit from another. This relationship is called IS-A , as in, “a Hand\\nis a kind of a Deck.”\\n• One class might depend on another in the sense that objects in one class take ob-\\njects in the second class as parameters, or use objects in the second class as part of a\\ncomputation. This kind of relationship is called a dependency .\\nAclass diagram is a graphical representation of these relationships. For example, Fig-\\nure 18.2 shows the relationships between Card ,Deck andHand .', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 198}),\n",

They would normally be shown with a dashed\\narrow. Or if there are a lot of dependencies, they are sometimes omitted.\\nA more detailed diagram might show that a Deck actually contains a listof Cards, but\\nbuilt-in types like list and dict are usually not included in class diagrams.\\n18.9 Debugging\\nInheritance can make debugging difﬁcult because when you invoke a method on an object,\\nit might be hard to ﬁgure out which method will be invoked.\\nSuppose you are writing a function that works with Hand objects. You would like it to\\nwork with all kinds of Hands, like PokerHands, BridgeHands, etc. If you invoke a method\\nlikeshuffle , you might get the one deﬁned in Deck , but if any of the subclasses override\\nthis method, you’ll get that version instead. This behavior is usually a good thing, but it\\ncan be confusing.\\nAny time you are unsure about the ﬂow of execution through your program, the sim-\\nplest solution is to add print statements at the beginning of the relevant methods. If\\nDeck.shuffle prints a message that says something like Running Deck.shuffle , then as\\nthe program runs it traces the ﬂow of execution.\\nAs an alternative, you could use this function, which takes an object and a method name\\n(as a string) and returns the class that provides the deﬁnition of the method:\\ndef find_defining_class(obj, meth_name):\\nfor ty in type(obj).mro():\\nif meth_name in ty.__dict__:\\nreturn ty\\nHere’s an example:\\n>>> hand = Hand()\\n>>> find_defining_class(hand, 'shuffle ')\\n<class '__main__.Deck '>\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 199}),\n",

It should take the same parameters, return the same type,\\nand obey the same preconditions and postconditions. If you follow this rule, you will ﬁnd\\nthat any function designed to work with an instance of a parent class, like a Deck, will also\\nwork with instances of child classes like a Hand and PokerHand.\\nIf you violate this rule, which is called the “Liskov substitution principle”, your code will\\ncollapse like (sorry) a house of cards.\\n18.10 Data encapsulation\\nThe previous chapters demonstrate a development plan we might call “object-oriented\\ndesign”.

In each case there is an obvious correspondence between the\\nobject and some entity in the real world (or at least a mathematical world).\\nBut sometimes it is less obvious what objects you need and how they should interact. In\\nthat case you need a different development plan.

If we read two\\ntexts, their preﬁxes and sufﬁxes would be added to the same data structures (which makes\\nfor some interesting generated text).\\nTo run multiple analyses, and keep them separate, we can encapsulate the state of each\\nanalysis in an object. Here’s what that looks like:\\nclass Markov:\\ndef __init__(self):\\nself.suffix_map = {}\\nself.prefix = ()\\nNext, we transform the functions into methods.

              " Document(page_content=\"Chapter 19\\nThe Goodies\\nOne of my goals for this book has been to teach you as little Python as possible. When\\nthere were two ways to do something, I picked one and avoided mentioning the other. Or\\nsometimes I put the second one into an exercise.\\nNow I want to go back for some of the good bits that got left behind. Python provides a\\nnumber of features that are not really necessary—you can write good code without them—\\nbut with them you can sometimes write code that’s more concise, readable or efﬁcient, and\\nsometimes all three.\\n19.1 Conditional expressions\\nWe saw conditional statements in Section 5.4. Conditional statements are often used to\\nchoose one of two values; for example:\\nif x > 0:\\ny = math.log(x)\\nelse:\\ny = float( 'nan')\\nThis statement checks whether xis positive. If so, it computes math.log . If not, math.log\\nwould raise a ValueError. To avoid stopping the program, we generate a “NaN”, which is\\na special ﬂoating-point value that represents “Not a Number”.\\nWe can write this statement more concisely using a conditional expression :\\ny = math.log(x) if x > 0 else float( 'nan')\\nYou can almost read this line like English: “ ygets log- xifxis greater than 0; otherwise it\\ngets NaN”.\\nRecursive functions can sometimes be rewritten using conditional expressions. For exam-\\nple, here is a recursive version of factorial :\\ndef factorial(n):\\nif n == 0:\\nreturn 1\\nelse:\\nreturn n * factorial(n-1)\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 204}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='184 Chapter 19. The Goodies\\nWe can rewrite it like this:\\ndef factorial(n):\\nreturn 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n-1)\\nAnother use of conditional expressions is handling optional arguments. For example, here\\nis the init method from GoodKangaroo (see Exercise 17.2):\\ndef __init__(self, name, contents=None):\\nself.name = name\\nif contents == None:\\ncontents = []\\nself.pouch_contents = contents\\nWe can rewrite this one like this:\\ndef __init__(self, name, contents=None):\\nself.name = name\\nself.pouch_contents = [] if contents == None else contents\\nIn general, you can replace a conditional statement with a conditional expression if both\\nbranches contain simple expressions that are either returned or assigned to the same vari-\\nable.\\n19.2 List comprehensions\\nIn Section 10.7 we saw the map and ﬁlter patterns. For example, this function takes a list\\nof strings, maps the string method capitalize to the elements, and returns a new list of\\nstrings:\\ndef capitalize_all(t):\\nres = []\\nfor s in t:\\nres.append(s.capitalize())\\nreturn res\\nWe can write this more concisely using a list comprehension :\\ndef capitalize_all(t):\\nreturn [s.capitalize() for s in t]\\nThe bracket operators indicate that we are constructing a new list. The expression inside\\nthe brackets speciﬁes the elements of the list, and the forclause indicates what sequence\\nwe are traversing.\\nThe syntax of a list comprehension is a little awkward because the loop variable, sin this\\nexample, appears in the expression before we get to the deﬁnition.\\nList comprehensions can also be used for ﬁltering. For example, this function selects only\\nthe elements of tthat are upper case, and returns a new list:\\ndef only_upper(t):\\nres = []\\nfor s in t:\\nif s.isupper():\\nres.append(s)\\nreturn res', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 205}),\n",

Generator expressions 185\\nWe can rewrite it using a list comprehension\\ndef only_upper(t):\\nreturn [s for s in t if s.isupper()]\\nList comprehensions are concise and easy to read, at least for simple expressions. And they\\nare usually faster than the equivalent for loops, sometimes much faster. So if you are mad\\nat me for not mentioning them earlier, I understand.\\nBut, in my defense, list comprehensions are harder to debug because you can’t put a print\\nstatement inside the loop. I suggest that you use them only if the computation is simple\\nenough that you are likely to get it right the ﬁrst time. And for beginners that means never.\\n19.3 Generator expressions\\nGenerator expressions are similar to list comprehensions, but with parentheses instead of\\nsquare brackets:\\n>>> g = (x**2 for x in range(5))\\n>>> g\\n<generator object <genexpr> at 0x7f4c45a786c0>\\nThe result is a generator object that knows how to iterate through a sequence of values. But\\nunlike a list comprehension, it does not compute the values all at once; it waits to be asked.\\nThe built-in function next gets the next value from the generator:\\n>>> next(g)\\n0\\n>>> next(g)\\n1\\nWhen you get to the end of the sequence, next raises a StopIteration exception. You can\\nalso use a forloop to iterate through the values:\\n>>> for val in g:\\n... print(val)\\n4\\n9\\n16\\nThe generator object keeps track of where it is in the sequence, so the for loop picks up\\nwhere next left off. Once the generator is exhausted, it continues to raise StopIteration :\\n>>> next(g)\\nStopIteration\\nGenerator expressions are often used with functions like sum,max, and min:\\n>>> sum(x**2 for x in range(5))\\n30\\n19.4 anyand all\\nPython provides a built-in function, any, that takes a sequence of boolean values and re-\\nturns True if any of the values are True .

The Goodies\\n>>> any([False, False, True])\\nTrue\\nBut it is often used with generator expressions:\\n>>> any(letter == 't'for letter in 'monty ')\\nTrue\\nThat example isn’t very useful because it does the same thing as the inoperator. But we\\ncould use anyto rewrite some of the search functions we wrote in Section 9.3. For example,\\nwe could write avoids like this:\\ndef avoids(word, forbidden):\\nreturn not any(letter in forbidden for letter in word)\\nThe function almost reads like English, “ word avoids forbidden if there are not any forbid-\\nden letters in word .”\\nUsing anywith a generator expression is efﬁcient because it stops immediately if it ﬁnds a\\nTrue value, so it doesn’t have to evaluate the whole sequence.\\nPython provides another built-in function, all, that returns True if every element of the\\nsequence is True . As an exercise, use allto re-write uses_all from Section 9.3.\\n19.5 Sets\\nIn Section 13.6 I use dictionaries to ﬁnd the words that appear in a document but not in a\\nword list. The function I wrote takes d1, which contains the words from the document as\\nkeys, and d2, which contains the list of words. It returns a dictionary that contains the keys\\nfrom d1that are not in d2.\\ndef subtract(d1, d2):\\nres = dict()\\nfor key in d1:\\nif key not in d2:\\nres[key] = None\\nreturn res\\nIn all of these dictionaries, the values are None because we never use them. As a result, we\\nwaste some storage space.\\nPython provides another built-in type, called a set, that behaves like a collection of dic-\\ntionary keys with no values. Adding elements to a set is fast; so is checking membership.\\nAnd sets provide methods and operators to compute common set operations.\\nFor example, set subtraction is available as a method called difference or as an operator,\\n-. So we can rewrite subtract like this:\\ndef subtract(d1, d2):\\nreturn set(d1) - set(d2)\\nThe result is a set instead of a dictionary, but for operations like iteration, the behavior is\\nthe same.\\nSome of the exercises in this book can be done concisely and efﬁciently with sets. For\\nexample, here is a solution to has_duplicates , from Exercise 10.7, that uses a dictionary:\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 207}),\n",

If the same element\\nappears again, the function returns True .\\nUsing sets, we can write the same function like this:\\ndef has_duplicates(t):\\nreturn len(set(t)) < len(t)\\nAn element can only appear in a set once, so if an element in tappears more than once, the\\nset will be smaller than t. If there are no duplicates, the set will be the same size as t.\\nWe can also use sets to do some of the exercises in Chapter 9. For example, here’s a version\\nofuses_only with a loop:\\ndef uses_only(word, available):\\nfor letter in word:\\nif letter not in available:\\nreturn False\\nreturn True\\nuses_only checks whether all letters in word are in available . We can rewrite it like this:\\ndef uses_only(word, available):\\nreturn set(word) <= set(available)\\nThe<=operator checks whether one set is a subset of another, including the possibility that\\nthey are equal, which is true if all the letters in word appear in available .\\nAs an exercise, rewrite avoids using sets.\\n19.6 Counters\\nA Counter is like a set, except that if an element appears more than once, the Counter\\nkeeps track of how many times it appears. If you are familiar with the mathematical idea\\nof a multiset , a Counter is a natural way to represent a multiset.\\nCounter is deﬁned in a standard module called collections , so you have to import it. You\\ncan initialize a Counter with a string, list, or anything else that supports iteration:\\n>>> from collections import Counter\\n>>> count = Counter( 'parrot ')\\n>>> count\\nCounter({ 'r': 2, 't': 1, 'o': 1, 'p': 1, 'a': 1})\\nCounters behave like dictionaries in many ways; they map from each key to the number of\\ntimes it appears. As in dictionaries, the keys have to be hashable.\\nUnlike dictionaries, Counters don’t raise an exception if you access an element that doesn’t\\nappear. Instead, they return 0:\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 208}),\n",

And they provide an often-useful method,\\nmost_common , which returns a list of value-frequency pairs, sorted from most common to\\nleast:\\n>>> count = Counter( 'parrot ')\\n>>> for val, freq in count.most_common(3):\\n... print(val, freq)\\nr 2\\np 1\\na 1\\n19.7 defaultdict\\nThecollections module also provides defaultdict , which is like a dictionary except that\\nif you access a key that doesn’t exist, it can generate a new value on the ﬂy.\\nWhen you create a defaultdict, you provide a function that’s used to create new values. A\\nfunction used to create objects is sometimes called a factory . The built-in functions that\\ncreate lists, sets, and other types can be used as factories:\\n>>> from collections import defaultdict\\n>>> d = defaultdict(list)\\nNotice that the argument is list , which is a class object, not list() , which is a new list.\\nThe function you provide doesn’t get called unless you access a key that doesn’t exist.\\n>>> t = d[ 'new key ']\\n>>> t\\n[]\\nThe new list, which we’re calling t, is also added to the dictionary. So if we modify t, the\\nchange appears in d:\\n>>> t.append( 'new value ')\\n>>> d\\ndefaultdict(<class 'list '>, { 'new key ': ['new value ']})\\nIf you are making a dictionary of lists, you can often write simpler code using defaultdict .\\nIn my solution to Exercise 12.2, which you can get from https://thinkpython.com/code/\\nanagram_sets.py , I make a dictionary that maps from a sorted string of letters to the list of\\nwords that can be spelled with those letters.

For example, the Point\\nobject deﬁned in Chapter 15 contains two numbers, xandy. When you deﬁne a class like\\nthis, you usually start with an init method and a str method:\\nclass Point:\\ndef __init__(self, x=0, y=0):\\nself.x = x\\nself.y = y\\ndef __str__(self):\\nreturn '(%g, %g) '% (self.x, self.y)\", metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 210}),\n",

They indicate that there is something wrong with the structure of the\\nprogram. Example: Omitting the colon at the end of a def statement generates the\\nsomewhat redundant message SyntaxError: invalid syntax .\\n• Runtime errors are produced by the interpreter if something goes wrong while the\\nprogram is running. Most runtime error messages include information about where\\nthe error occurred and what functions were executing. Example: An inﬁnite recur-\\nsion eventually causes the runtime error “maximum recursion depth exceeded”.\\n• Semantic errors are problems with a program that runs without producing error mes-\\nsages but doesn’t do the right thing. Example: An expression may not be evaluated\\nin the order you expect, yielding an incorrect result.\\nThe ﬁrst step in debugging is to ﬁgure out which kind of error you are dealing with. Al-\\nthough the following sections are organized by error type, some techniques are applicable\\nin more than one situation.\\nA.1 Syntax errors\\nSyntax errors are usually easy to ﬁx once you ﬁgure out what they are. Unfortunately,\\nthe error messages are often not helpful. The most common messages are SyntaxError:\\ninvalid syntax and SyntaxError: invalid token , neither of which is very informa-\\ntive.\\nOn the other hand, the message does tell you where in the program the problem occurred.\\nActually, it tells you where Python noticed a problem, which is not necessarily where the\\nerror is.

At the same time, remember that the book might be\\nwrong, so if you see something that looks like a syntax error, it might be.\\nHere are some ways to avoid the most common syntax errors:\\n1. Make sure you are not using a Python keyword for a variable name.\\n2. Check that you have a colon at the end of the header of every compound statement,\\nincluding for,while ,if, and defstatements.\\n3. Make sure that any strings in the code have matching quotation marks. Make sure\\nthat all quotation marks are “straight quotes”, not “curly quotes”.\\n4. If you have multiline strings with triple quotes (single or double), make sure you\\nhave terminated the string properly. An unterminated string may cause an invalid\\ntoken error at the end of your program, or it may treat the following part of the\\nprogram as a string until it comes to the next string. In the second case, it might not\\nproduce an error message at all!\\n5. An unclosed opening operator— (,{, or[—makes Python continue with the next line\\nas part of the current statement. Generally, an error occurs almost immediately in the\\nnext line.\\n6. Check for the classic =instead of ==inside a conditional.\\n7. Check the indentation to make sure it lines up the way it is supposed to. Python\\ncan handle space and tabs, but if you mix them it can cause problems. The best way\\nto avoid this problem is to use a text editor that knows about Python and generates\\nconsistent indentation.\\n8.

These are some of the most common runtime errors:\\nNameError: You are trying to use a variable that doesn’t exist in the current environment.\\nCheck if the name is spelled right, or at least consistently. And remember that local\\nvariables are local; you cannot refer to them from outside the function where they are\\ndeﬁned.\\nTypeError: There are several possible causes:\\n• You are trying to use a value improperly. Example: indexing a string, list, or\\ntuple with something other than an integer.\\n• There is a mismatch between the items in a format string and the items passed\\nfor conversion. This can happen if either the number of items does not match or\\nan invalid conversion is called for.\\n• You are passing the wrong number of arguments to a function. For methods,\\nlook at the method deﬁnition and check that the ﬁrst parameter is self . Then\\nlook at the method invocation; make sure you are invoking the method on an\\nobject with the right type and providing the other arguments correctly.\\nKeyError: You are trying to access an element of a dictionary using a key that the dictio-\\nnary does not contain. If the keys are strings, remember that capitalization matters.\\nAttributeError: You are trying to access an attribute or method that does not exist. Check\\nthe spelling! You can use the built-in function vars to list the attributes that do exist.\\nIf an AttributeError indicates that an object has NoneType , that means that it is None .\\nSo the problem is not the attribute name, but the object.\\nThe reason the object is none might be that you forgot to return a value from a func-\\ntion; if you get to the end of a function without hitting a return statement, it returns\\nNone . Another common cause is using the result from a list method, like sort , that\\nreturns None .\\nIndexError: The index you are using to access a list, string, or tuple is greater than its\\nlength minus one. Immediately before the site of the error, add a print statement to\\ndisplay the value of the index and the length of the array. Is the array the right size?\\nIs the index the right value?\\nThe Python debugger ( pdb) is useful for tracking down exceptions because it allows you to\\nexamine the state of the program immediately before the error.

First, scale down the problem\\nthe program is working on. For example, if you are searching a list, search a small list. If\\nthe program takes input from the user, give it the simplest input that causes the problem.\\nSecond, clean up the program. Remove dead code and reorganize the program to make\\nit as easy to read as possible. For example, if you suspect that the problem is in a deeply\\nnested part of the program, try rewriting that part with simpler structure. If you suspect a\\nlarge function, try splitting it into smaller functions and testing them separately.\\nOften the process of ﬁnding the minimal test case leads you to the bug. If you ﬁnd that\\na program works in one situation but not in another, that gives you a clue about what is\\ngoing on.\\nSimilarly, rewriting a piece of code can help you ﬁnd subtle bugs. If you make a change\\nthat you think shouldn’t affect the program, and it does, that can tip you off.\\nA.3 Semantic errors\\nIn some ways, semantic errors are the hardest to debug, because the interpreter provides\\nno information about what is wrong. Only you know what the program is supposed to do.\\nThe ﬁrst step is to make a connection between the program text and the behavior you are\\nseeing. You need a hypothesis about what the program is actually doing. One of the things\\nthat makes that hard is that computers run so fast.\\nYou will often wish that you could slow the program down to human speed, and with\\nsome debuggers you can.

If you write a\\nprogram that doesn’t do what you expect, often the problem is not in the program; it’s in\\nyour mental model.\\nThe best way to correct your mental model is to break the program into its components\\n(usually the functions and methods) and test each component independently. Once you\\nﬁnd the discrepancy between your model and reality, you can solve the problem.\\nOf course, you should be building and testing components as you develop the program.\\nIf you encounter a problem, there should be only a small amount of new code that is not\\nknown to be correct.\\nA.3.2 I’ve got a big hairy expression and it doesn’t do what I expect.\\nWriting complex expressions is ﬁne as long as they are readable, but they can be hard to\\ndebug.

For example, if you are translating the expressionx\\n2πinto Python,\\nyou might write:\\ny = x / 2 * math.pi\\nThat is not correct because multiplication and division have the same precedence and are\\nevaluated from left to right. So this expression computes xπ/2.\\nA good way to debug expressions is to add parentheses to make the order of evaluation\\nexplicit:\\ny = x / (2 * math.pi)\\nWhenever you are not sure of the order of evaluation, use parentheses.

See http://en.wikipedia.\\norg/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms .\\nThe practical goal of algorithm analysis is to predict the performance of different algo-\\nrithms in order to guide design decisions.\\nDuring the 2008 United States Presidential Campaign, candidate Barack Obama was asked\\nto perform an impromptu analysis when he visited Google. Chief executive Eric Schmidt\\njokingly asked him for “the most efﬁcient way to sort a million 32-bit integers.” Obama\\nhad apparently been tipped off, because he quickly replied, “I think the bubble sort would\\nbe the wrong way to go.” See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8 .\\nThis is true: bubble sort is conceptually simple but slow for large datasets. The an-\\nswer Schmidt was probably looking for is “radix sort” ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\\nRadix_sort )1.\\nThe goal of algorithm analysis is to make meaningful comparisons between algorithms,\\nbut there are some problems:\\n• The relative performance of the algorithms might depend on characteristics of the\\nhardware, so one algorithm might be faster on Machine A, another on Machine B.\\nThe general solution to this problem is to specify a machine model and analyze the\\nnumber of steps, or operations, an algorithm requires under a given model.\\n• Relative performance might depend on the details of the dataset. For example, some\\nsorting algorithms run faster if the data are already partially sorted; other algorithms\\n1But if you get a question like this in an interview, I think a better answer is, “The fastest way to sort a million\\nintegers is to use whatever sort function is provided by the language I’m using. Its performance is good enough\\nfor the vast majority of applications, but if it turned out that my application was too slow, I would use a proﬁler\\nto see where the time was being spent. If it looked like a faster sort algorithm would have a signiﬁcant effect on\\nperformance, then I would look around for a good implementation of radix sort.”', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 222}),\n",

It is sometimes useful to analyze average case performance, but that’s\\nusually harder, and it might not be obvious what set of cases to average over.\\n• Relative performance also depends on the size of the problem. A sorting algorithm\\nthat is fast for small lists might be slow for long lists. The usual solution to this\\nproblem is to express run time (or number of operations) as a function of problem\\nsize, and group functions into categories depending on how quickly they grow as\\nproblem size increases.\\nThe good thing about this kind of comparison is that it lends itself to simple classiﬁcation\\nof algorithms. For example, if I know that the run time of Algorithm A tends to be pro-\\nportional to the size of the input, n, and Algorithm B tends to be proportional to n2, then I\\nexpect A to be faster than B, at least for large values of n.\\nThis kind of analysis comes with some caveats, but we’ll get to that later.\\nB.1 Order of growth\\nSuppose you have analyzed two algorithms and expressed their run times in terms of the\\nsize of the input: Algorithm A takes 100 n+1 steps to solve a problem with size n; Algo-\\nrithm B takes n2+n+1 steps.\\nThe following table shows the run time of these algorithms for different problem sizes:\\nInput Run time of Run time of\\nsize Algorithm A Algorithm B\\n10 1 001 111\\n100 10 001 10 101\\n1 000 100 001 1 001 001\\n10 000 1 000 001 100 010 001\\nAtn=10, Algorithm A looks pretty bad; it takes almost 10 times longer than Algorithm\\nB. But for n=100 they are about the same, and for larger values A is much better.\\nThe fundamental reason is that for large values of n, any function that contains an n2term\\nwill grow faster than a function whose leading term is n. The leading term is the term with\\nthe highest exponent.\\nFor Algorithm A, the leading term has a large coefﬁcient, 100, which is why B does better\\nthan A for small n. But regardless of the coefﬁcients, there will always be some value of n\\nwhere an2>bn, for any values of aand b.\\nThe same argument applies to the non-leading terms. Even if the run time of Algorithm A\\nwere n+1000000, it would still be better than Algorithm B for sufﬁciently large n.\\nIn general, we expect an algorithm with a smaller leading term to be a better algorithm for\\nlarge problems, but for smaller problems, there may be a crossover point where another\\nalgorithm is better. The location of the crossover point depends on the details of the algo-\\nrithms, the inputs, and the hardware, so it is usually ignored for purposes of algorithmic\\nanalysis.

The\\nexception is if you can show that the loop exits after a constant number of iterations. If a\\nloop runs ktimes regardless of n, then the loop is in O(na), even for large k.\\nMultiplying by kdoesn’t change the order of growth, but neither does dividing. So if the\\nbody of a loop is in O(na)and it runs n/ktimes, the loop is in O(na+1), even for large k.\\nMost string and tuple operations are linear, except indexing and len, which are constant\\ntime. The built-in functions min and max are linear.

The\\nstring method join is linear; the run time depends on the total length of the strings.\\nMost list methods are linear, but there are some exceptions:\\n• Adding an element to the end of a list is constant time on average; when it runs\\nout of room it occasionally gets copied to a bigger location, but the total time for n\\noperations is O(n), so the average time for each operation is O(1).\\n• Removing an element from the end of a list is constant time.\\n• Sorting is O(nlogn).\\nMost dictionary operations and methods are constant time, but there are some exceptions:\\n• The run time of update is proportional to the size of the dictionary passed as a pa-\\nrameter, not the dictionary being updated.\\n•keys ,values and items are constant time because they return iterators.

In the worst case it has to traverse the entire\\ncollection, so the run time is linear.\\nThe inoperator for sequences uses a linear search; so do string methods like find and\\ncount .\\nIf the elements of the sequence are in order, you can use a bisection search , which is\\nO(logn). Bisection search is similar to the algorithm you might use to look a word up\\nin a dictionary (a paper dictionary, not the data structure). Instead of starting at the be-\\nginning and checking each item in order, you start with the item in the middle and check\\nwhether the word you are looking for comes before or after. If it comes before, then you\\nsearch the ﬁrst half of the sequence. Otherwise you search the second half. Either way, you\\ncut the number of remaining items in half.\\nIf the sequence has 1,000,000 items, it will take about 20 steps to ﬁnd the word or conclude\\nthat it’s not there. So that’s about 50,000 times faster than a linear search.\\nBisection search can be much faster than linear search, but it requires the sequence to be in\\norder, which might require extra work.\\nThere is another data structure, called a hashtable that is even faster—it can do a search\\nin constant time—and it doesn’t require the items to be sorted. Python dictionaries are\\nimplemented using hashtables, which is why most dictionary operations, including the in\\noperator, are constant time.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 226}),\n",

Analysis of Algorithms\\nB.4 Hashtables\\nTo explain how hashtables work and why their performance is so good, I start with a simple\\nimplementation of a map and gradually improve it until it’s a hashtable.\\nI use Python to demonstrate these implementations, but in real life you wouldn’t write\\ncode like this in Python; you would just use a dictionary! So for the rest of this chapter, you\\nhave to imagine that dictionaries don’t exist and you want to implement a data structure\\nthat maps from keys to values. The operations you have to implement are:\\nadd(k, v) :Add a new item that maps from key kto value v. With a Python dictionary, d,\\nthis operation is written d[k] = v .\\nget(k) :Look up and return the value that corresponds to key k. With a Python dictionary,\\nd, this operation is written d[k] ord.get(k) .\\nFor now, I assume that each key only appears once. The simplest implementation of this\\ninterface uses a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair.\\nclass LinearMap:\\ndef __init__(self):\\nself.items = []\\ndef add(self, k, v):\\nself.items.append((k, v))\\ndef get(self, k):\\nfor key, val in self.items:\\nif key == k:\\nreturn val\\nraise KeyError\\naddappends a key-value tuple to the list of items, which takes constant time.\\ngetuses a forloop to search the list: if it ﬁnds the target key it returns the corresponding\\nvalue; otherwise it raises a KeyError . Sogetis linear.\\nAn alternative is to keep the list sorted by key. Then getcould use a bisection search, which\\nisO(logn). But inserting a new item in the middle of a list is linear, so this might not be the\\nbest option. There are other data structures that can implement add and get in log time,\\nbut that’s still not as good as constant time, so let’s move on.\\nOne way to improve LinearMap is to break the list of key-value pairs into smaller lists.\\nHere’s an implementation called BetterMap , which is a list of 100 LinearMaps. As we’ll\\nsee in a second, the order of growth for get is still linear, but BetterMap is a step on the\\npath toward hashtables:\\nclass BetterMap:\\ndef __init__(self, n=100):\\nself.maps = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\nself.maps.append(LinearMap())', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 227}),\n",

A limitation of this implementation is that it only works with hashable keys.\\nMutable types like lists and dictionaries are unhashable.\\nHashable objects that are considered equivalent return the same hash value, but the con-\\nverse is not necessarily true: two objects with different values can return the same hash\\nvalue.\\nfind_map uses the modulus operator to wrap the hash values into the range from 0 to\\nlen(self.maps) , so the result is a legal index into the list. Of course, this means that many\\ndifferent hash values will wrap onto the same index. But if the hash function spreads things\\nout pretty evenly (which is what hash functions are designed to do), then we expect n/100\\nitems per LinearMap.\\nSince the run time of LinearMap.get is proportional to the number of items, we expect\\nBetterMap to be about 100 times faster than LinearMap. The order of growth is still linear,\\nbut the leading coefﬁcient is smaller. That’s nice, but still not as good as a hashtable.\\nHere (ﬁnally) is the crucial idea that makes hashtables fast: if you can keep the maximum\\nlength of the LinearMaps bounded, LinearMap.get is constant time. All you have to do is\\nkeep track of the number of items and when the number of items per LinearMap exceeds\\na threshold, resize the hashtable by adding more LinearMaps.\\nHere is an implementation of a hashtable:\\nclass HashMap:\\ndef __init__(self):\\nself.maps = BetterMap(2)\\nself.num = 0\\ndef get(self, k):\\nreturn self.maps.get(k)\\ndef add(self, k, v):\\nif self.num == len(self.maps.maps):', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 228}),\n",

The real work happens in add, which checks the number\\nof items and the size of the BetterMap : if they are equal, the average number of items per\\nLinearMap is 1, so it calls resize .\\nresize makes a new BetterMap , twice as big as the previous one, and then “rehashes” the\\nitems from the old map to the new.\\nRehashing is necessary because changing the number of LinearMaps changes the denomi-\\nnator of the modulus operator in find_map . That means that some objects that used to hash\\ninto the same LinearMap will get split up (which is what we wanted, right?).\\nRehashing is linear, so resize is linear, which might seem bad, since I promised that add\\nwould be constant time. But remember that we don’t have to resize every time, so addis\\nusually constant time and only occasionally linear. The total amount of work to run addn\\ntimes is proportional to n, so the average time of each addis constant time!\\nTo see how this works, think about starting with an empty HashTable and adding a se-\\nquence of items. We start with 2 LinearMaps, so the ﬁrst 2 adds are fast (no resizing re-\\nquired). Let’s say that they take one unit of work each. The next add requires a resize, so\\nwe have to rehash the ﬁrst two items (let’s call that 2 more units of work) and then add the\\nthird item (one more unit). Adding the next item costs 1 unit, so the total so far is 6 units\\nof work for 4 items.\\nThe next addcosts 5 units, but the next three are only one unit each, so the total is 14 units\\nfor the ﬁrst 8 adds.\\nThe next addcosts 9 units, but then we can add 7 more before the next resize, so the total is\\n30 units for the ﬁrst 16 adds.\\nAfter 32 adds, the total cost is 62 units, and I hope you are starting to see a pattern. After n\\nadds, where nis a power of two, the total cost is 2 n−2 units, so the average work per add\\nis a little less than 2 units. When nis a power of two, that’s the best case; for other values of\\nnthe average work is a little higher, but that’s not important. The important thing is that it\\nisO(1).\\nFigure B.1 shows how this works graphically. Each block represents a unit of work. The\\ncolumns show the total work for each add in order from left to right: the ﬁrst two adds cost\\n1 unit each, the third costs 3 units, etc.', metadata={'source': 'book.pdf', 'page': 229}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='B.5. Glossary 209\\nFigure B.1: The cost of a hashtable add.\\nThe extra work of rehashing appears as a sequence of increasingly tall towers with increas-\\ning space between them. Now if you knock over the towers, spreading the cost of resizing\\nover all adds, you can see graphically that the total cost after nadds is 2 n−2.\\nAn important feature of this algorithm is that when we resize the HashTable it grows\\ngeometrically; that is, we multiply the size by a constant. If you increase the size\\narithmetically—adding a ﬁxed number each time—the average time per addis linear.\\nYou can download my implementation of HashMap from https://thinkpython.com/\\ncode/Map.py , but remember that there is no reason to use it; if you want a map, just use a\\nPython dictionary.\\nB.5 Glossary\\nanalysis of algorithms: A way to compare algorithms in terms of their run time and/or\\nspace requirements.\\nmachine model: A simpliﬁed representation of a computer used to describe algorithms.\\nworst case: The input that makes a given algorithm run slowest (or require the most\\nspace).\\nleading term: In a polynomial, the term with the highest exponent.\\ncrossover point: The problem size where two algorithms require the same run time or\\nspace.\\norder of growth: A set of functions that all grow in a way considered equivalent for pur-\\nposes of analysis of algorithms.

In this case, though, we are assigning values to named elements of\\nan object. These elements are called attributes .\\nAs a noun, “AT-trib-ute” is pronounced with emphasis on the ﬁrst syllable, as opposed to\\n“a-TRIB-ute”, which is a verb.\\nFigure 15.1 is a state diagram that shows the result of these assignments. A state diagram\\nthat shows an object and its attributes is called an object diagram .\\nThe variable blank refers to a Point object, which contains two attributes. Each attribute\\nrefers to a ﬂoating-point number.\\nYou can read the value of an attribute using the same syntax:\", metadata={'page': 169, 'source': 'book.pdf'}),\n",

They would normally be shown with a dashed\\narrow. Or if there are a lot of dependencies, they are sometimes omitted.\\nA more detailed diagram might show that a Deck actually contains a listof Cards, but\\nbuilt-in types like list and dict are usually not included in class diagrams.\\n18.9 Debugging\\nInheritance can make debugging difﬁcult because when you invoke a method on an object,\\nit might be hard to ﬁgure out which method will be invoked.\\nSuppose you are writing a function that works with Hand objects. You would like it to\\nwork with all kinds of Hands, like PokerHands, BridgeHands, etc. If you invoke a method\\nlikeshuffle , you might get the one deﬁned in Deck , but if any of the subclasses override\\nthis method, you’ll get that version instead. This behavior is usually a good thing, but it\\ncan be confusing.\\nAny time you are unsure about the ﬂow of execution through your program, the sim-\\nplest solution is to add print statements at the beginning of the relevant methods. If\\nDeck.shuffle prints a message that says something like Running Deck.shuffle , then as\\nthe program runs it traces the ﬂow of execution.\\nAs an alternative, you could use this function, which takes an object and a method name\\n(as a string) and returns the class that provides the deﬁnition of the method:\\ndef find_defining_class(obj, meth_name):\\nfor ty in type(obj).mro():\\nif meth_name in ty.__dict__:\\nreturn ty\\nHere’s an example:', metadata={'page': 199, 'source': 'book.pdf'}),\n",

As\\nan example, we will create a type called Point that represents a point in two-dimensional\\nspace.\\nIn mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating\\nthe coordinates. For example, (0, 0)represents the origin, and (x,y)represents the point x\\nunits to the right and yunits up from the origin.\\nThere are several ways we might represent points in Python:\\n• We could store the coordinates separately in two variables, xandy.\\n• We could store the coordinates as elements in a list or tuple.\\n• We could create a new type to represent points as objects.\\nCreating a new type is more complicated than the other options, but it has advantages that\\nwill be apparent soon.\\nA programmer-deﬁned type is also called a class .

              " Document(page_content='162 Chapter 17. Classes and methods\\nThis observation is the motivation for methods ; a method is a function that is associated\\nwith a particular class. We have seen methods for strings, lists, dictionaries and tuples. In\\nthis chapter, we will deﬁne methods for programmer-deﬁned types.\\nMethods are semantically the same as functions, but there are two syntactic differences:\\n• Methods are deﬁned inside a class deﬁnition in order to make the relationship be-\\ntween the class and the method explicit.\\n• The syntax for invoking a method is different from the syntax for calling a function.\\nIn the next few sections, we will take the functions from the previous two chapters and\\ntransform them into methods. This transformation is purely mechanical; you can do it by\\nfollowing a sequence of steps. If you are comfortable converting from one form to another,\\nyou will be able to choose the best form for whatever you are doing.\\n17.2 Printing objects\\nIn Chapter 16, we deﬁned a class named Time and in Section 16.1, you wrote a function\\nnamed print_time :\\nclass Time:\\n\"\"\"Represents the time of day.\"\"\"\\ndef print_time(time):\\nprint( \\'%.2d:%.2d:%.2d \\'% (time.hour, time.minute, time.second))\\nTo call this function, you have to pass a Time object as an argument:\\n>>> start = Time()\\n>>> start.hour = 9\\n>>> start.minute = 45\\n>>> start.second = 00\\n>>> print_time(start)\\n09:45:00\\nTo make print_time a method, all we have to do is move the function deﬁnition inside the\\nclass deﬁnition. Notice the change in indentation.\\nclass Time:\\ndef print_time(time):\\nprint( \\'%.2d:%.2d:%.2d \\'% (time.hour, time.minute, time.second))\\nNow there are two ways to call print_time . The ﬁrst (and less common) way is to use\\nfunction syntax:\\n>>> Time.print_time(start)\\n09:45:00\\nIn this use of dot notation, Time is the name of the class, and print_time is the name of the\\nmethod. start is passed as a parameter.\\nThe second (and more concise) way is to use method syntax:\\n>>> start.print_time()\\n09:45:00', metadata={'page': 183, 'source': 'book.pdf'})]"

              "[Document(page_content='Preface\\nThe strange history of this book\\nIn January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had\\ntaught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high\\nand, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.\\nOne of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary\\ndetail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all\\nsuffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then\\nsomewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much\\nnew material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.\\nTwo weeks before the ﬁrst day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:\\n• Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.\\n• Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize jargon and deﬁne each term at ﬁrst\\nuse.\\n• Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difﬁcult topics and split them\\ninto a series of small steps.\\n• Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum\\nuseful subset of Java and left out the rest.\\nI needed a title, so on a whim I chose How to Think Like a Computer Scientist .\\nMy ﬁrst version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood\\nenough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most\\nimportant) letting the students practice.\\nI released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to\\ncopy, modify, and distribute the book.\\nWhat happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted\\nmy book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the\\nunusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book. As Green Tea Press, I\\npublished the ﬁrst Python version in 2001.', metadata={'page': 4, 'source': 'book.pdf'}),\n",
